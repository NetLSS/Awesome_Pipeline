AN UNEXPLAINED MURDER OF THREE WOMEN
n 2017, the prime and really only suspect of a horrific and heartless crime vanished. And to this day, despite leaving behind a trail of clues, they've never been caught. On June 19th, 2017, police arrived at a quaint farmhouse property in Idaho to come to whir chi on is a mienes op your it mim His or ali plind, dhor one sues The is eciel road in in home he neody had her feman of them in event age same hine i was refe.
When the first officer arrives at the ranch, he's immediately hit with a smell that stops him cold in his tracks. He knows exactly what it is before he walks any further-the smell of something rotting. There's a shed near the house, and that's where the odour seems to be coming from. So he radios in some backup and starts to make his way over to investigate. The closer he gets, the stronger the smell gets, and the sheer number of flies swarming around him increases immensely. He can feel in his gut that he's about to discover something he doesn't want to see. But he proceeds anyway.
When he finally opens the door to the shed, sunlight shines through the crack and into the small storage area before him. There on the floor is a bright blue tarp, and it's draped over something, or rather, someone. As he pulls back the tarp, he slowly reveals the bodies of three people laying side by side, all of whom had been brutally killed and left to rot in the shed, likely for days. As it was essentially the peak of summer, the weather had sped up the decomposition process substantially, making it hard for anyone to determine who the deceased individuals were, though it wasn't hard for friends and family members alike to assume that owner Mike, his girlfriend, Nadia, and her daughter, Payton, are the corpses on their property. But once authorities were able to identify the bodies, they were faced with a shocking twist that nobody ever expected.
While two of the bodies did indeed belong to the trio who occupied the home, one of them did not, which left everyone with two harrowing questions: who was this mysterious stranger lying dead on someone else's property, and perhaps even more chilling, where in the world was the missing third resident? As the puzzle pieces of this convoluted case started to come together, the victims' loved ones would come to one chilling conclusion.
By the time Nadia Medley was in her mid-40s, her 13-year-old daughter, Payton, was her entire life. But the single mother often had trouble making ends meet after her husband passed away in 2014. She also sadly lost a child shortly after its birth around the same time. For a while, Nadia and Payton were essentially all each other had in the world. But that was all about to change. Nadia worked as a massage therapist in Ogden, Utah, and she wasn't in a hurry to find love again so soon after being widowed.
In 2015, a charming man with immense presence and personality walked into Nadia's work in need of a massage. The man, who went by the name Mike, was undeniably striking to Nadia. Almost right away, there was a spark between the two, a connection that neither of them could seem to control, which, of course, is how their unexpected relationship started. Mike was a catch, a private pilot for clients who often needed him to fly all over the country at any given time. He made good money, was well-travelled, and just happened to be a divorcee for 10 years. It seemed as though fate brought Mike into Nadia's life, as the two were beyond perfect for each other. Their relationship started off slowly, though it quickly grew more serious as the months went on. From after-work dates to hikes with Nadia and Payton, Mike demonstrated his commitment to this new-found love. After all, he knew just how much heartbreak Nadia had already experienced. He made his girlfriend's daughter just as much of a priority in his life, picking Payton up from school, taking her on lunch dates, teaching her how to shoot, and building such a strong bond with her that soon enough, she started to call him Dad.
Nadia's friends saw a dramatic change in the woman when she met Mike, saying that he was the first reason she smiled in a long time and that she had a constant happy glow when they were together. It was clear to everyone that Nadia's new romance was flourishing. But all relationships have their honeymoon phase, and according to Nadia's best friend, there was a little turmoil that started to brew as time went on. Apparently, Nadia asked Mike two or three times for help paying the mortgage. After a few times of being asked, Mike firmly declined, saying that they were moving too fast and he couldn't do this. But Nadia was not buying it. She had seen one of his paychecks, which reportedly showed that Mike made $10,000 in a single month. Nadia knew that Mike made a lot of money as a pilot, and she didn't understand why he wasn't willing to help her out financially. This heated dispute became a point of contention and eventually led to a brief separation between the pair.
However, their love was like a magnet, pulling them back to one another in no time. After all, Mike's work often took him far from home for a considerable amount of time, sometimes for weeks on end, which can definitely put some strain on a relationship. The distance and time, it seemed, had nothing on the bond they had formed. In fact, it had only made Mike realise that he couldn't bear to spend so much time away from Nadia and Payton anymore. This once-causal relationship needed to be more permanent. So Mike ended up purchasing a ranch in Caldwell, Idaho, and told Nadia that he simply couldn't let her think he wasn't ready for commitment. He invited her and Payton to move in with him and promised the two of them anything they wanted-open fields, horses, dogs, rabbits, anything-to make them happy and allow them to live a full life with him.
In June of 2017, Nadia needed to take a trip back to Utah to pick up some of the horses that Mike had purchased for the ranch. Mike himself couldn't go pick them up because he had to work and wouldn't be around. So Nadia volunteered to do so. Except on the weekend of June 9th, when she was supposed to arrive at the pickup destination for the horses, Nadia never showed up. The worker she was supposed to meet decided to call her just to check in. Perhaps it was just a simple misunderstanding, or perhaps it was much more than that. When Nadia never answered the phone and never returned any calls, it became clear that there was something very, very wrong. Family friends of Nadia's and Payton's started to experience the same thing on their end, noting that they hadn't even heard from Payton since June 6th, which was the last time she had sent them a text message. Payton's friend, Sidney, started to grow more concerned by the day. Both she and Payton were completely addicted to their phones. There was no feasible reason why Payton wouldn't respond to a text or a call for this long.
When no one could get hold of Mike either, it felt as though the entire family simply vanished into thin air. So Sidney convinced her mother to step in and investigate whatever was going on with Payton and her family. Together, the two called 911 and had someone dispatched over to Nadia and Mike's property to check it out and see if everything was okay. Mike's concerned relatives also called to request a welfare check, where they found three badly decomposed dead bodies. This is where things get crazy.
Eventually, officers were able to get dental records back to identify the mysterious third body. It was a woman, and her name was Cheryl Baker. She was also an Ogden, Utah, local, but although Cheryl had been from the area, she had virtually no connection to Nadia and Payton while she had been alive. However, she did have a connection to Mike. Cheryl Baker was his wife for seven full years, up until her sudden death. Cheryl and Mike were married for five whole years before Mike even started dating Nadia. Not only was Mike cheating on Cheryl by starting an entire new family with Nadia, but the home's mistress and her daughter lived in Ogden, which was only eight miles away from where Mike had lived with his wife the whole time. He could easily move back and forth between his two partners without raising any suspicion.
He literally could not get proper funding to actually buy the ranch he moved into with Nadia and Payton. So he had Cheryl purchase the property for him, telling her that it would become their retirement home. All the while that Nadia had been sharing excited posts about moving to the idyllic rural land, so too had Cheryl been gushing with colleagues about how she just couldn't wait to spend her retirement in the beautiful countryside with the man she loved. Most notably, the ever-creative Cheryl, who loved crafting, taught art, and even made her own wedding dress, wished to turn the large shed on the farm into her very own art studio. She had just retired as a teacher on June 6th, after spending many years working at schools for the deaf and blind. Although she had agreed to stay behind and sell their Utah home, while he was supposed to live in a trailer on the Idaho property by himself and fix it up nice for her, she suddenly decided to drive five hours to where the property is located, excited to pleasantly surprise her husband with an impromptu visit.
Upon arrival, she was perplexed to find that there was a substantial amount of progress being made on the property and confused when she saw a fully functioning home with a car parked in the driveway and animals running around. This was her property, and she surely hasn't been working on it. She probably thought Mike was having some construction and remodelling done for the two of them as some kind of surprise. Presumably, the two women found out that Mike had been cheating on both of them with each other. It's likely that they were both incredibly frustrated with themselves and each other, but mostly Mike. And at some point, police assume that Mike must have discovered that the two women had found out about each other,
unravelling his secret life. That's when officers believe he became violent, as his whole world came crashing down in an instant. It is alleged that he took out his anger on not only Cheryl but also Nadia and even young Payton. The three gruesome bodies on the property were tragically identified as belonging to none other than sweet and considerate Nadia Medley, her innocent daughter Payton, and Cheryl Baker.
When the bodies of the victims were analysed, it became clear that they had all three been shot in the head execution style before their corpses were discarded into the shed on Mike's property. In addition, while some of the animals on the property were alive and roaming around, such as a snake and some rabbits, several animals, presumably family pets, were found dead, including some birds and three dogs, who, just like the human victims, had been shot execution style. All of the specifics of how that came to happen were unknown to almost everyone except Mike himself. But he was nowhere to be found. Cheryl's relatives came forward to say that the whole time Mike was having an affair with Nadia, nobody noticed any signs of him pulling away from his wife. They remembered him as a supportive husband who made time to spend holidays with the in-laws and go on outdoor family adventures. On a similar note, one of Nadia's friends was so confused by the news reports.
Oddly, the last text a friend received from Cheryl around the time she would have been heading to the Idaho property read, "Take care of my dogs. I don't know if I'm coming back." At first, this wasn't too concerning, as the recipient of the message just assumed Cheryl had decided to take a backpacking trip with Mike, as they were known to do. But then again, many have raised the question of how to know that Cheryl's even the one who sent that text. CBS reported that the text was sent around June 11th, and authorities believe the crime occurred on the eighth or ninth. So with that in mind, maybe Mike really was behind the odd message.
According to investigators, Mike actually spent the first 24 hours in Idaho after the deaths of Nadia, Payton, and Cheryl. One neighbour told reporters that she had actually heard screams near the property in the middle of the night, around the time when the murders would have taken place, but she didn't call the police because she wasn't sure if it was an animal or a woman, and she figured that a neighbour who lived closer to the farmhouse would report the strange activity if it was really serious.
What's more, other neighbours would actually report hearing gunshots around the time of the crime. But then again, this was not really a big deal. The rural area was full of hunters and target shooters. So, of course, neighbours would assume the gunshots were from recreational use.
However, from the victims' manner of death, it appears that there may not have been all that much of a struggle that could have alerted anyone in the first place. It is believed that Nadia, Payton, and Cheryl all died from a single gunshot wound to the head. Investigators say that on the morning of June 10th, Mike casually went to get breakfast in the next town over in Nampa, Idaho. It seems like he wasn't even in a rush to get away. And apparently, he wasn't scared to show his face in public. After enjoying his morning meal, Mike was heading back to Utah. Once back in Utah, Mike switched out his truck for Cheryl's car, which had been having some maintenance done, in an effort to throw investigators off his trail. And finally, on June 11th, Mike was seen on video entering the Bridger-Teton National Forest in Wyoming, which is the last known location of Mike, as it was the last time police were able to track him. After some searching, authorities were able to locate Cheryl's car at an abandoned campsite, but Mike wasn't anywhere to be found.
There are a variety of theories surrounding Mike's current whereabouts. Amongst the most popular is the fact that he easily could have managed to hitchhike his way out of the national forest, and maybe even out of Wyoming. However, some people also theorised that Mike could have just continued his way through the woods and taken his own life out of guilt. Canyon County Sheriff Kieran Donahue has even said multiple times that his instincts lead him to believe that Mike is dead. What's interesting is that many of his old friends actually theorise that he could have used his trademark charm and charisma to convince another unsuspecting woman to take him in.
On July 20th, nine days after Mike entered Bridger-Teton National Forest, a couple of workers from a recreation centre reported seeing someone who looked just like Mike in a tent at a camp spot less than two hours from where his car was found. On June 28th, a tip was received from someone who thought they saw Mike driving south on Interstate 15, near Salt Lake City, while others reported possible sightings of the fugitive in Pocatello. Police dogs, helicopters, and infrared technology have all been employed in the expansive and intensive search for the suspected killer on the loose. But all to no avail. What's really weird is that one sheriff stated plainly that they collected evidence that indicates Mike is dead, but he stands firm that they cannot be closed-minded in this investigation.
Mike is really the only person of interest in the murder of Nadia, Payton, and Cheryl and needs to be located, dead or alive, as soon as possible. Now I'd like to pass this story off to you. What do you think happened to Nadia, Payton, and Cheryl? Why would Mike remain on the run if he is not responsible for their deaths, and where do you think he is currently?

세 여성의 미제 살인사건
2017년, 끔찍하고 냉혹한 범죄의 주범으로 지목된 유일한 용의자가 흔적도 없이 사라졌다. 그리고 오늘날까지, 여러 단서를 남겼음에도 불구하고 그는 붙잡히지 않았다.

2017년 6월 19일, 경찰은 아이다호의 한 한적한 농가 주택에 출동했다. 이 집은 외딴 시골길 끝자락에 위치해 있었고, 경찰이 도착했을 당시 집안은 조용하고 이상한 기운이 감돌고 있었다.

첫 번째 경찰관이 목장에 도착하자마자, 그는 발길을 멈추게 만드는 강한 악취를 맡았다. 그는 냄새의 정체를 즉시 알아차렸다. 그가 더 이상 앞으로 나아가기 전에 이미 그것이 '부패한 사체의 냄새'라는 것을 직감하고 있었다.

집 근처에는 작은 헛간이 있었고, 그 악취는 바로 그곳에서 나는 듯했다. 경찰관은 무전을 통해 지원을 요청하고는 헛간 쪽으로 조심스럽게 다가갔다. 가까이 갈수록 악취는 점점 더 심해졌고, 주변에는 날파리가 떼 지어 날아다니고 있었다. 그는 곧 무언가 끔찍한 광경을 보게 될 것이라는 예감을 떨칠 수 없었다. 그럼에도 그는 멈추지 않고 문을 열었다.

헛간의 문이 열리자 햇빛이 좁은 창고 안으로 스며들었다. 바닥에는 파란색 방수천이 덮여 있었고, 그 아래에는 무언가가 놓여 있었다. 경찰관이 천천히 방수천을 걷어 올리자, 나란히 누워 있는 세 구의 시신이 모습을 드러냈다. 이들은 모두 잔인하게 살해당한 뒤, 이 헛간 안에 방치된 채로 썩어가고 있었다. 여름 한복판의 더운 날씨 탓에 시신의 부패는 빠르게 진행되어 있었고, 신원을 식별하는 것이 어려운 상황이었다.

하지만 가족과 친구들은, 집 주인 마이크, 그의 여자친구 나디아, 그리고 나디아의 딸 페이튼이 이 시신들이 아닐까 추측하고 있었다. 경찰이 신원 확인을 진행한 결과, 충격적인 사실이 드러났다. 세 구의 시신 중 두 구는 확실히 집에 거주하던 세 사람 중 두 명이 맞았지만, 나머지 한 구는 이들과 전혀 관련 없는 인물이었다.

이로 인해 두 가지 무서운 질문이 떠올랐다. 첫째, 이 낯선 여성은 누구인가? 둘째, 집에 살던 세 번째 사람은 어디로 사라진 것인가?

---

나디아와 마이크, 그리고 비극의 시작
나디아 메들리는 40대 중반의 여성이었고, 13살 딸 페이튼이 그녀의 전부였다. 그녀는 남편을 2014년에 잃은 뒤, 생계를 유지하는 데 어려움을 겪고 있었다. 같은 해에 출산 직후 아이 한 명을 잃기도 했다. 그 이후로 나디아와 페이튼은 서로가 세상에서 유일한 가족이었다.

나디아는 유타주 오그던에서 마사지 치료사로 일하고 있었고, 남편을 잃은 이후로 사랑을 다시 찾는 데 급하지 않았다. 그러나 2015년, 마이크라는 한 남성이 마사지를 받기 위해 그녀의 직장으로 찾아왔다. 그는 단번에 나디아의 눈길을 사로잡았다.

마이크는 뛰어난 외모와 강한 존재감을 지닌 남성이었고, 개인 조종사로서 고객들을 위해 전국을 날아다니는 일이 많았다. 그는 높은 수입을 올리고 있었으며, 여행도 자주 다녔고, 10년 전 이혼한 상태였다. 마이크는 나디아에게 이상적인 인물처럼 보였다.

그들의 관계는 천천히 시작되었지만, 시간이 지나면서 급속히 진지해졌다. 퇴근 후 데이트를 하고, 나디아와 페이튼을 데리고 하이킹도 다니면서 마이크는 가족으로서의 책임감을 보여주었다. 그는 나디아가 겪어온 아픔을 잘 알고 있었고, 그녀의 딸 페이튼 역시 소중히 대했다. 마이크는 페이튼을 학교에서 데려오고, 점심을 같이 먹으며, 사격을 가르치기도 했고, 그렇게 둘의 관계는 점점 깊어져 갔다. 얼마 지나지 않아 페이튼은 마이크를 ‘아빠’라고 부르기 시작했다.

나디아의 친구들은 그녀가 마이크를 만난 이후 눈에 띄게 밝아졌다고 말했다. 오랜만에 웃음을 되찾은 그녀는 항상 행복해 보였고, 마이크와 함께 있을 때면 눈에 띄게 빛나고 있었다. 그들의 사랑은 주변 사람들에게도 분명해 보였다.

하지만 모든 연애에는 ‘허니문 기간’이 있고, 시간이 흐르면서 갈등이 싹트기 시작했다. 나디아의 절친에 따르면, 나디아는 마이크에게 두세 차례 주택 담보 대출을 갚는 데 도움을 요청했다. 마이크는 처음에는 이해하는 듯했지만, 결국에는 "우리가 너무 빨리 가고 있다"며 단호하게 거절했다. 그러나 나디아는 마이크의 말을 믿지 않았다. 그녀는 마이크의 월급 명세서를 본 적이 있었고, 한 달에 1만 달러를 벌고 있다는 것을 알고 있었다.

조종사로서의 마이크는 분명히 높은 수입을 올리고 있었고, 그가 도와줄 능력이 있음에도 불구하고 거절하는 이유를 나디아는 납득하지 못했다. 결국 이 문제는 둘 사이의 큰 갈등으로 번졌고, 한때는 잠시 결별하는 상황까지 갔다.

하지만 두 사람은 결국 다시 만났다. 마이크의 일 특성상 그는 자주 집을 비웠고, 때로는 몇 주 동안 멀리 떨어져 있어야 했다. 이런 장거리 연애는 그들에게 부담이 되었지만, 오히려 서로에 대한 감정을 더 절실하게 만들었다. 마이크는 더 이상 나디아와 페이튼 없이 지내고 싶지 않다는 결론을 내렸다.

그는 아이다호 콜드웰에 있는 한 농장을 구입했고, 나디아에게 진지한 의도를 보여주고자 했다. 그는 나디아와 페이튼을 자신의 집으로 초대하면서, “말, 개, 토끼 등 원하는 건 뭐든지 다 해줄게. 함께 행복한 삶을 살자”고 약속했다.
