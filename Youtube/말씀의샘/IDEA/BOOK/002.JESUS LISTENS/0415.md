April 15
Precious Jesus,
Through reading Your Word, I've seen that waiting, trusting, and hoping are intricately connected-like golden strands woven together to form a strong chain. I think of trusting as the central strand because this attitude is taught so frequently
throughout the Bible. Waiting and hoping embellish the central strand and strengthen the chain that connects me to You.
Waiting for You to work, with my eyes fixed on You, shows that I really do trust You. But if I simply mouth the words "I trust You" while anxiously trying to make things go my way, my words ring hollow.
Hoping is future-directed, connecting me to my glorious inheritance in heaven. However, as You have shown me, the benefits of hope fall fully on me in the present.
Because I belong to You, I don't just pass time in my waiting. I can wait expectantly, in hopeful trust. Please help me stay alert so I can pick up even the faintest glimmer of Your Presence.
In Your trustworthy Name,
Amen
JOHN 14:1; PsALM 56:3-4 NASB; PsALM 27:14 ESV; 1 JoHN 3:3 NKJV
