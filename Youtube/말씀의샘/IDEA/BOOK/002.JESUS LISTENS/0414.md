April 14
Prince of Peace,
I come to You, feeling weary and burdened. I want to spend time resting in Your Presence. I need Your Peace continually, just as I need You each moment.
When things are going smoothly in my life, it's easy to forget how dependent on You I really am. Then, when I encounter bumps in the road, I tend to become anxious and upset. Eventually, this revives my awareness of my need for You, and I return
to You- seeking Your Peace. I'm thankful that You give me this glorious gift, but it's hard for me to receive it until I calm down. How much better it would be to stay close to You at all times!
Please help me remember that You, my Prince, are Mighty God! All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to You. Whenever I'm experiencing hard times, I can come to You and tell You my troubles. But I need to come humbly, acknowledging
how great and wise You are. Rather than shaking my fist at You or insisting that You do things my way, I can pray these wonderful words of David: "I trust in You, O Lord; I say, 'You are my God' My times are in Your hands."
In Your majestic Name, Jesus,
Amen
