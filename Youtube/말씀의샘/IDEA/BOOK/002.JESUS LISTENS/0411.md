April 11
Dearest Jesus,
I believe in You-even though I do not see You with my eyes. I know You are far more real than the things I can see all around me. So when I believe in You, I'm trusting in rock-solid Reality! No matter what my circumstances may be, You are the
indestructible Rock on which I stand. I'm thankful I can always take refuge in You because I belong to You forever.
You've been teaching me that believing in You has innumerable benefits. Of course, the most obvious one is the eternal salvation of my soulâ€”a gift of infinite value! My belief in You also enhances my present life immensely, enabling me to know Whose
I am and who I am. You help me find my way through this broken world with hope in my heart as I stay in close communication with You.
Lord, You have been enlarging my capacity for Joy. The more I seek You and the more fully I come to know You, the more You fill me with inexpressible and glorious Joy!
In Your Name above all names,
Amen
