April 18
Steadfast Jesus,
Help me to keep my focus on You. You created me with the amazing ability to choose the focal point of my thoughts. This is a sign of being made in Your image. Yet I've seen that if my mind gets stuck on worries, they can develop into idols. Anxiety
gains a life of its own, infesting my mind like a parasite. Thankfully, I can break free from this bondage by affirming my trust in You and refreshing myself in Your Presence.
What goes on in my mind is invisible to other people, but You read my thoughts continually-You know everything about me. I want to guard my thinking carefully since good thought-choices honor You and keep me close to You.
My goal is to take captive every thought to make it obedient to You. When my mind wanders from You, I need to capture those thoughts and bring them into Your Presence. In Your radiant Light, anxious thoughts shrink and shrivel up. Judgmental
thinking is unmasked as I bask in Your merciful Love. Confused ideas are untangled while I rest in the simplicity of Your Peace. Your Word assures me that You will keep in perfect Peace all who trust in You-whose thoughts are fixed on You!
diane Light, anxious thoughts shrink and ahrivel up udemental
In Your comforting Name,
Amen
