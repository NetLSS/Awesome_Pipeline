April 12
Worthy God,
The Bible assures me that Your blessing is on those who trust in You, who put their confidence in You. Please help me to trust You in every detail of my life. I know that nothing is random in Your kingdom. All things work together and are fitting into a plan
for good-for those who love You and are called according to Your purpose.
Instead of trying to figure everything out, I want to focus my energy on trusting and thanking You. I'm learning that nothing is wasted when I walk close to You. You've shown me that even my mistakes and sins can be recycled into something good
-through Your transforming grace.
While I was still living in darkness, You began shining the Light of Your holy Presence into my sin-stained life. At the right time, You lifted me out of the slimy pit, out of the mud and mire. You set my feet on a rock and gave me a firm place to stand.
Thank You for calling me out of darkness into Your marvelous Light. Because of all You have done, I'm convinced that You can be trusted in every facet of my life!
In Your splendid Name, Jesus,
Amen
