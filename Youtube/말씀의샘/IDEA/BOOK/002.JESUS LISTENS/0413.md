April 13
Mighty Jesus,
When things don't go as I would like, help me to accept the situation immediately. I realize that fantasizing about how things might have gone is a waste of time and energy. Moreover, I've learned that if I indulge in feelings of regret, they can easily spill over into resentment. I need to remember that You are sovereign over all my circumstances—and humble myself under Your mighty hand, casting all my anxiety on You. I can rejoice in what You are doing in my life, even though it's beyond my understanding.
You are the Way, the Truth, and the Life. In You I have everything I need —for this life and for the life yet to come. I don't want to let the impact of the world shatter my thinking or draw my attention away from You. The challenge I face each moment
is to keep my eyes on You—no matter what is going on around me. When You are central in my thinking, I can view circumstances from Your perspective. This enables me to walk with You along the path of life, experiencing Joy in Your Presence.
In Your matchless Name,
Amen
