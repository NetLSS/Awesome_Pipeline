April 17
Compassionate Jesus,
You have been teaching me that anxiety is a result of envisioning the future without You. So my best defense against worry is staying in communication with You. When I turn my thoughts toward You, I can give all my worries and cares to You, knowing that You care about me. Help me remember to read Your Word and listen as I'm praying - making my thoughts a dialogue with You.
Thank You for providing guidelines for me to follow whenever I'm considering upcoming events: First, I must not linger in the future because anxieties sprout up like mushrooms when I wander there. Second, I need to remember the promise of Your continual Presence-and include You in my thoughts as I plan future events. I confess that this mental discipline is challenging for me; my mind easily slips into daydreaming while I'm making plans. But I'm learning that the glorious reality of Your Presence with me, now and forevermore, outshines any daydream I could ever imagine!
In Your brilliant Name,
Amen
