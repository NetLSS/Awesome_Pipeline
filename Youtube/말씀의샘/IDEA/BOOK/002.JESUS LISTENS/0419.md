April 19
All-knowing God,
You have searched me and known me. You understand my thoughts from afar, and You are intimately acquainted with all my ways. How thankful I am to be fully known by You! Everything about me is visible to You-including my most secret thoughts and feelings. This transparency would terrify me if I were not Your beloved child. But I have nothing to fear because Your perfect righteousness has been credited to me through my faith in You. I'm so grateful to be a permanent member of Your royal family!
I've been learning that my intimate relationship with You is a powerful antidote to feelings of loneliness. Please remind me to voice my prayers to You whenever I'm feeling alone or afraid. I know that You hear my silent prayers too, but I think more clearly when I whisper my words or speak them out loud. Because You understand me and my circumstances perfectly, I don't need to explain things to You. I can dive right in, asking You to help me cope with the things I'm facing. And I can spend time
In Your royal Name, Jesus,
Amen
