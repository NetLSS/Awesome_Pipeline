April 16
My loving Lord,
Thank You for loving me regardless of how well I'm performing. Sometimes I feel uneasy-questioning whether I'm doing enough to be worthy of Your Love. But I realize that no matter how exemplary my behavior may be, the answer to that question will always be no. You've been showing me that my performance and Your Love are completely different issues. You have loved me with an everlasting Love that flows outward from eternity without limits or conditions. You have clothed me in Your robe of righteousness, and this is an eternal transaction. Nothing and no one can reverse it! This means that my successes and failures have no bearing on Your Love for me.
I've discovered that even my ability to evaluate how well I'm doing is flawed. My limited human perspective and the condition of my body, with its mercurial variations, distort my assessment of my behavior.
Lord, I bring my performance anxiety to You, and I ask You to replace it with Your unfailing Love. Help me to stay aware of Your loving Presence with me in everything I do. Please direct my steps as I go through this day
In Your precious Name, Jesus,
Amen
