'주님'이라 부르기 전에, 이것부터 확인하라!

예수님의 말씀이 부담스러운가?

이 말씀, 교회는 말하지 않는다

순종 없는 '주여 주여'는 의미 없다

천국에 못 들어가는 사람의 특징

왜 예수님은 '주여' 부르지 말라 하셨는가?

예수님의 50가지 명령, 당신은 알고 있는가?

주의 말씀에 순종하지 않으면서… 주님이라 부르는가?

Here's a detailed, high-impact thumbnail concept based on your script, crafted to grab attention and convey the seriousness and urgency of the message:

**THUMBNAIL WITH TEXT:**
```
Visual Elements:
- A split scene with dramatic contrast:
  • On the left side: A brightly lit, serene image of Jesus standing at a narrow gate, reaching out gently to a person who appears hesitant but curious. The setting is warm with golden light spilling over a peaceful path.
  • On the right side: A dark, chaotic crowd walking toward a wide, fiery gate in the distance. Some people in the crowd are holding smartphones, distracted, or arguing—symbolizing modern-day "Sunday worshipers" missing the message.
  
- Centered in the foreground: A distressed churchgoer wearing modern clothing, holding a Bible, but looking confused or conflicted—caught between both paths.

- Floating above the person: Semi-transparent text of Luke 6:46 in ancient script style, like it’s being spoken from above, giving it a divine authority.

Text Overlay:
- Big, bold white and red text across the top:
  **"DON'T CALL HIM LORD IF YOU WON'T OBEY!"**
  
- Small yellow banner in the bottom right:
  **CHAPTER 1 • The Hard Truth**
  
Mood & Color:
- High contrast: divine golden light vs ominous shadows.
- Use subtle glowing effects around the "narrow gate" side to draw the eye.
- Slight vignette around the edges for cinematic intensity.

Click Trigger:
- The tension between the divided paths and the emotional conflict in the churchgoer's face visually asks: “Which side are *you* on?”
```
