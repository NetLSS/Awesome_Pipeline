A MEDITATION PRACTICE
FOR THE SEVEN SPIRITUAL CENTERS
There are as many ways to meditate as their are meditators. Nevertheless, the following is a good method to use for working with the spiritualization of body and mind, using the seven spiritual centers in combination with the Universal Mind and
Spirit of God.
A Warning
The Edgar Cayce readings warn all meditators: "Make haste SLOWLY! Prepare the body, prepare the mind, before ye attempt to loosen it in such measures or manners that it may be taken hold upon by those influences which constantly seek expressions of self rather than of a living, constructive influence of a CRUCIFIED Savior. Then, crucify desire in self; that ye may be awakened to the real abilities of helpfulness that lie within thy grasp...Without preparation, desires of EVERY nature may become so accentuated as to destroy..."
Therefore, let's examine our purposes, searching our hearts for our true passion and purposes. Is it cooperation and coordination with God, or are we still longing to gratify some lingering desires of our own self interests?
The Taoist meditators of The Secret of the Golden Flower (translated by Richard Wilhelm with depth-psychologist Carl Jung's insights) talk about the right method being like one wing of a bird. They explain that the other wing is the right heart. The
bird cannot fly with only one wing. All seekers must have the right heart as well as the right method.
Preparation should include searching out and adjusting the heart's desires, crucifying desire in self so that we may be awakened to the real abilities of helpfulness that lie within our grasp. A helpful way to assure this is to set an ideal.
The Ideal
The Taoist concept of the right heart leads us naturally to the Cayce teaching that an ideal should guide us as we seek to awaken the life force. We need to ask ourselves, What is our ideal? To whom or to what do we look for examples of better behavior, better choices, better uses of our energy, and better ways to interact with others? What standard guides us? Who is the author of our "Book of Life"? Is it the circumstances of life? Do they rule us? Or do we set a direction and a standard by which we, using our free will, determine what the way, the truth, and the light is that we seek?
These are important questions from the perspective of the Cayce readings that should be considered before raising the powerful life forces with this method of meditation. As the readings say, we can build a Frankenstein or a god using basically the
same meditation method. It all depends on the ideal held as the practice progresses.
"FIND that which is to YOURSELF the more certain way to your consciousness of PURIFYING body and mind, before ye attempt to enter into the meditation as to raise the image of that through which ye are seeking to know the will or the activity
of the Creative Forces; for ye are RAISING in meditation actual CREATION taking place within the inner self!"
The readings would advise anyone who feels unable to "set the carnal aside" and attune to a higher ideal for the period of meditation not to meditate. Instead of meditating, you should pray. If the praying then changes your disposition, and you feel
that you can set the carnal forces aside, then you may enter into meditation. Otherwise, stay away from it. Meditation gives power to whatever thoughts and desires one is carrying. Make sure these are pure and of the highest.
Jesus Christ - More than a Religious Figure
The Cayce readings present Jesus Christ as not only a high ideal, but as a powerful force of protection for anyone seeking to loosen the life forces, open the bio-spiritual seals, sound the trumpets, and enter into the presence of God. Christ is presented as a protective conduit to God for all seekers. To call on this protection and guidance is to call on the greatest resource available. However, the readings do not put the religion that formed around Jesus Christ above other religions. The readings are universal. From Cayce's readings we learn that "Christ is not a man;" Jesus was the man that manifested the spirit that is called Christ. This spirit is the light of all seekers, not just Christians (though many of them think so). Seekers from any religious faith can use the power of Christ in their meditation practice and still remain loyal to their religion. Here's an example of this perspective, from reading 281-13, his parentheses:
"If there has been set the mark (mark meaning here the image that is raised by the individual in its imaginative and impulse force) such that it takes the form of the ideal the individual is holding as its standard to be raised to, ...then the individual (or the image) bears the mark of the Lamb, or the Christ, or the Holy One, or the Son, or any of the names we may have given to that which enables the individual to enter THROUGH IT into the very presence of that which is the creative force from within itself - see?....
"Raising then in the inner self that image of the Christ, love of God-Consciousness, is making the body so cleansed as to be barred against all powers that would in any manner hinder."
Notice how Christ is given as equivalent to the "love of God-Consciousness." Seekers from any religion may have love of God-Consciousness. Christ in this perspective is more universal than the religion that possesses that name. Notice also how
"love of God-Consciousness" cleanses us of self-interests that may hinder or harm us.
However, there is much more to this reading than ecumenicity and protection. Cayce is giving us a great insight into just how a meditator may be transported from a good meditative stillness into the very presence of the Creative Force, God - with all the ramifications of such an experience. If in our imaginative forces we can conceive or form the ideal (the standard) to which we seek to be raised, then we, as the Revelation states, bear the mark or the sign of that power (whatever name we give it) that enables us to enter through it into the very presence of God, the Creative Force, within us. Despite the power of other techniques, keeping the ideal in the mind is seminal to transformation.
Reading 1458-1 points out our only limitation: "The entity is only limited to that it sets as its ideal." We are "gods in the making" if we can conceive ourselves to be such - in cooperation and coordination with the Great God.
The Kundalini and Eternal Life The kundalini or life force is within the human body, the temple. Normally it is used in ways that dissipate it, eventually leading to aging and death of the body. All people are allowed to use their life force as they choose (at least within the parameters of their karma). Whether they dissipate it consciously or unconsciously makes no difference. When it's gone, it's gone. But it doesn't have to be this way. As the readings put it, " if there will be gained that consciousness, there need not be ever the necessity of a physical organism aging ... seeing this, feeling this, knowing this, ye will find that not only does the body become revivified, but by the creating in every atom of its being the knowledge of the activity of this Creative Force... spirit,
mind, body [are] renewed."
The "elan vital" of the Western world and the "kundalini" of the Eastern world follow natural laws and can be made to flow in rejuvenative ways which enhance and extend the life. This is not only possible with kundalini meditation, but it is a valuable goal to pursue. Here's one of Cayce's statement on this: "How is the way shown by the Master? What is the promise in Him? The last to be overcome is death. Death of what? The soul cannot die, for it is of God. The body may be revivified, rejuvenated. And it is to that end it may, the body, transcend the earth and its influence" (262-85). This meditation practice works directly with the forces of life.

Prayer Words
Now let's look at the mechanics of this method. Assuming that our ideals, purposes and hearts are in the right place, that we have crucified our selfish desires, conceived of our ideal, and drawn on the power and protection of the Christ, "love of God-Consciousness" - let's begin with prayer words for the seven chakras. These words vary with different practices, but the Cayce readings teach that one reason the Master created the Lord's Prayer was for this purpose. The Lord's Prayer is in two place in the New Testament: Matt. 6:9-13 and Luke 11:2-4. The readings give a slightly different version of the prayer, which we'll use. The readings are also comfortable with the feminine aspect of the Godhead as well as the masculine, so let's also use this. As you say the prayer, feel the meaning of the words as your consciousness is directed to the location of the chakra. (Note: In the readings, Cayce identified the first key word as heaven, but in the book published by the New York Study Group they identified it with the word Father. The word heaven was the original given by Cayce and is the better choice here.)
A CHART OF THE LORD'S PRAYER & THE 7 CENTERS
Spiritual Center
Key Word
Our Father who art in
HEAVEN,_
Hallowed be thy
NAME._
Thy kingdom come. Thy
WILL_
so on Earth.
Give us this day our daily
BREAD.
And forgive us our
DEBTS_
And lead us not into
TEMPTATION,
Third Eye - Pituitary - 7th
Crown-Pineal - 6th
Throat - Thyroid -5th be done, as it is in Heaven,
Root-Gonads- 1st
Solar Plexus - Adrenals - 3rd as we forgive our debtors.
Navel - Cells of Leydig - 2nd but deliver us from
EVIL._
Some practitioners of this prayer-to-centers method add the following:
For Thine is the
KINGDOM POWER
GLORY forever.
Heart - Thymus - 4th
Throat - Thyroid - 5th and the Crown- Pineal - 6th and the Third Eye - Pituitary - 7th
To fully realize the power of this prayer, one must understand that it is intended to call forth the highest in each chakra. We must feel or imagine the change brought on by these words and their meanings. Take your time. Consider this as part of
the meditation period.
The order of the chakra prayer is significant in that it attempts to awaken the higher chakras before awakening the lower ones. This is the best approach. Awakening the lower chakra before the higher ones is like opening the cobra basket without the music of the snake charmer's flute. The serpent is loose to its own interests, rather than under the charm of the higher music. Keep a higher ideal, a higher purpose, a right heart, and the consciousness focused predominantly on the higher centers.
Draw the kundalini upward.

Breath Power
Most meditation methods throughout the ages have included some form of breathing practice. Why? Because breath is part of the deeper nervous system, and taking hold of it awakens the deeper mind that is watching over the breath. Autonomic functions are under the control of the subconscious mind. An easy way to move out of our normal, everyday conscious mind is to willfully take hold of a function that is normally under the control of the subconscious. Nothing will get its attention faster.
Let us now use the breath in ways that arouse the life force and draw it up through the spiritual centers of this wonderful bio-spiritual instrument in which we abide. Cayce's readings explain that "BREATH is the basis of the living organism's
activity..This opening of the centers or the raising of the life force may be brought about by certain characters of breathing - for, as indicated, the breath is power in itself; and this power may be directed..." There are several breathing patterns we may use. The first is described often in the readings. It begins with a deep inhalation through the right nostril, filling the lungs, and feeling strength throughout our body! Then, exhale slowly and steadily
through the mouth. Do three of these inhalations and exhalations.
As you do this right nostril inhalation and mouth exhalation, keep your focus on the spiritual centers in the torso of your body (root, navel, solar plexus, and heart). Feel the power and strength rising from these and radiating to the whole of the body.
Now shift to inhaling through the left nostril, but rather than exhaling through the mouth, exhale through the right nostril. During these three breaths feel yourself holding to your ideal and opening the seven spiritual centers to higher vibrations
of the Spirit. Do three of these inhalations and exhalations.
As you do this left-right nostril breathing, keep your focus on the spiritual centers in your neck and head, letting the other centers open toward these higher ones. This will not be difficult, because the fifth, sixth, and seventh centers have a natural
magnetism - just as the snake charmer's music. They will draw the serpent energy upward.
I have noticed that this second set of inhalations and exhalations is more gentle and internalizing than the first set, which is more enlivening and strengthening.
When you have finished this breathing pattern, you may go through the prayer again slowly, directing your attention to each chakra as you recite the phrase and key word.
Now let's do a different breathing method.
Breathe through your nostrils in a normal manner, but with each inhalation, feel or imagine the life force being drawn up from the lower parts of your torso to the crown of your head and over to your frontal lobe and third-eye center. Hold the breath while imagining the breath of God uniting with your breath (or imagine the breath of the Holy Spirit uniting with yours, if that suits you better). Then as you exhale, feel or imagine the life force bathing the chakras as it descends through them to the lowest center. Once the lungs are empty, pause in this stillness. When it feels right, inhale again, feeling or imagining the drawing upward of the life force to the higher centers, uniting with The Breath of Life and then bathing the centers again.
Repeat this cycle at a comfortable pace - using your consciousness and breath to direct the movement of energy in synchronization with the inhalations and exhalations. As the breath and life force rise, feel or imagine how they are contributing to the raising of vibrations and consciousness, and uniting with the Omnipotent. As they descend, feel how the united energy bathes the centers and the body with this spiritualized energy. Take your time. Consider the breathing exercises as part of the meditation. You may do from three to seven cycles of inhalations and exhalations, depending on what feels good to you.
Here is Cayce's comment on breathing practices: "These exercises [yoga breathing] are excellent.... Thus an entity puts itself, through such an activity into association or in conjunction with all it has EVER been or may be. For it loosens the physical
consciousness to the universal consciousness... Thus ye may constructively use that ability of spiritual attunement, which is the birthright of each soul; ye may use it as a helpful influence in thy experiences in the earth."
Of course, when you've finished the breathing exercises, let the breath go back on "autopilot." Your autonomic system will naturally take breathing back into its control again.
Chanting and Incantation
After the breathing exercises it is a good time to use a rising chant or incantation. In many of the ancient mystery schools chanting went hand in hand with breathing exercises. Why? Because it is the easiest, handiest way to raise vibrations and
change consciousness. Our bio-spiritual bodies are equipped with a voice box that can create some of the most wonderful, ethereal vibrations and direct them to each of the spiritual centers within us. Sound affects us profoundly.
Good chanting is an inner sounding which vibrates, stimulates, and lifts the life force upward. It is done in a droning manner, with a monotone, resonant, humming-like tone. We pass air through the vocal cords using our diaphragms, creating a vibrating sound that is then directed to the individual chakras, thus vibrating them. Feel the centers being tuned to the specific sound, and then carry your consciousness upward as the sound changes. Do this chanting three or more times or until you feel its effect. You may also want to finish this chanting portion of the practice with a few soundings of the great OM chant (as in home).
Here is one of the most frequent chants given through the Edgar Cayce readings. The sounds are aaaa-eeee-000o-mmmm. The aaaa sounds are directed into the lower torso area (root and navel centers). Then, as the sound changes to eeee, bring your consciousness upward as you draw the bodily energy up to the center of your torso (solar plexus and heart). The oooo sounding draws mind and energy to the throat and head area (throat and crown chakras). And the mmmm sounds to the frontal lobe of the brain (third eye). For many years practitioners of this Cayce chant used rrrr as the first sound, but in reading 2072-10, Cayce stated that "this is not R, but Ah," as the a in spa.
If you would like to use a chant that the Cayce readings said was used in ancient Egypt, try this one. It uses the vowel sounds with the addition of an ending mmmm sound. Breathe in deeply, then as you very slowly exhale, direct your consciousness to the lowest chakra and begin moving the life force upward as you chant in a resonant drone ah ah ah ah ah, a a a a a, e e e ee, iiiii, o o ooo, uuuuu, m m m m m. Each sound is associated with a chakra. Ah with the root chakra (sounds like the a in spa). A with the lyden center (sounds like long a in able). E with the solar plexus (sounds like long e in eve). I with the heart (a long i, as in high). O with the throat (long o as in open). U with the pineal (sounds like the u in true). And, m with the third eye (like humming the m in room).
The key is to vibrate the sounds in your body around the area of each chakra. Don't linger too long on the lower centers and sounds. Save breath for the all important mmmm sounding at the great frontal lobe of your brain. Again, I want to point out that the Cayce readings and many classical images consider the crown chakra to be the sixth center and the third eye to be the seventh, even though most yoga books teach otherwise. But do what feels best to you. I've found Cayce's reversing of these to be helpful in my meditations.
Often at this point in the meditation you should be feeling a little high. Your consciousness should be lifted. Your vibrations should be up. Your forehead and crown may have pronounced sensations, and the upper body and head may be moving back and forth, or side to side, or in a circular motion. Your head may be drawn back. These are all natural results of the practice and are identified as such in the Cayce readings. In the Revelation the disciple John associates body-shaking ("earthquakes") with the opening of the sixth center, followed by "silence in heaven" as the seventh center opens. Or you may feel completely still and totally quiet. Sensations are not the goal. At-onement with the "Om of the Omnipotent," as Cayce once described it, is the goal. Of course, you may consider this to be oneness with God, oneness with the Infinite, Universal Consciousness.
