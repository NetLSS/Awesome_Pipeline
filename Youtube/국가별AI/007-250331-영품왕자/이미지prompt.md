Every detail of his appearance has been meticulously curated, showcasing the unmistakable codes of high fashion and aristocratic grace.

He wears a tailored, double-breasted coat crafted from fine, monogrammed fabric — the iconic Louis Vuitton pattern subtly woven into the textile in a deep, smoky charcoal with hints of gold thread catching the light.

Altogether, the image doesn’t just suggest fashion — it declares Louis Vuitton as royalty in the world of style, and this prince is its living embodiment: refined, powerful, and impossibly stylish.
