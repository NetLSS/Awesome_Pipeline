I'm sitting in the driver's seat of my car, my left hand firmly gripping the steering wheel at the ten o'clock position. My right hand occasionally lifts from my lap—sometimes to pick up my phone resting in the center console, sometimes to take a sip from the iced coffee in the cupholder. The steering wheel feels smooth and cool beneath my palm, with slight vibrations from the road beneath the tires.

Outside the windshield, the road stretches ahead under a wide, pale blue sky. It's late morning, and the sun casts a warm glow, creating soft reflections on the glass surfaces of other cars. I’m driving down a multi-lane road, probably a suburban street or an open highway. The lane markings are bright white, clearly visible against the asphalt. Some parts of the road are slightly cracked or patched, typical of older pavement.

To the right, the sidewalk runs parallel to the road, lined with evenly spaced streetlights and rows of trees—some tall and leafy, others small and freshly planted. I pass by shopping plazas, gas stations, fast-food drive-thrus, and the occasional strip mall, with signs advertising everything from tacos to tire repairs.

People are walking on the sidewalk—some with dogs, others pushing strollers or carrying grocery bags. A jogger in a neon tank top paces steadily ahead. Cyclists ride in the bike lane, helmets on, heads down, focused.

On the left, cars in the opposite lane pass by—SUVs, sedans, pickup trucks, some old and dusty, others brand new with polished exteriors. One car has its windows rolled down, music blasting faintly as it speeds past. A school bus turns at an intersection, bright yellow and full of kids, their faces pressed to the windows.

Traffic lights ahead blink from green to yellow, and I ease my foot onto the brake, slowing to a smooth stop. I hear the faint hum of the engine, the whir of passing cars, and the low whoosh of air conditioning from the dashboard vents. A soft breeze flows through a crack in the driver-side window.

It’s a typical American day—spacious roads, wide-open skies, and a rhythm to the surroundings that feels both familiar and alive. Everything moves—people, cars, time—and yet there’s a stillness to just driving and watching the world roll by.
