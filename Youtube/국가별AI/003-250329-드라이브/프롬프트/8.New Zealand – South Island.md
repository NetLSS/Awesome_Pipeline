My left hand grips the steering wheel, fingers relaxed but steady. The black leather is warm beneath my palm, kissed by the afternoon sun filtering through the windshield. My right hand rests lightly on my lap, occasionally reaching over to pick up my phone to change the music or lift a reusable bottle filled with cool, citrus-infused water. The scent of lemon mingles subtly with the fresh alpine air streaming in through the slightly cracked window.

Outside, the world rolls by in slow, awe-inspiring grandeur. I'm driving down a winding road carved through a living postcard — this is New Zealand’s South Island, and every turn feels like stepping into a hidden sanctuary of Earth.

To my left, dense forests of ancient beech trees stretch endlessly, their emerald canopies swaying with the wind, like a gentle wave across a green ocean. Sunbeams dance through the leaves, flickering across the dashboard in rhythm with the road’s twists and curves.

Far ahead and to the right, majestic mountains rise like ancient gods — the Southern Alps. Their sharp peaks are capped with shimmering snow, even in late summer. Jagged and dignified, they wear their icy crowns in silent, stoic pride. I can see glaciers clinging to the creases between them, like time itself frozen in motion. Their blue veins glisten under the high, pale sun.

The road dips slightly and I catch a glimpse of a vast, turquoise lake. It stretches along the valley floor like melted sky — still, deep, and impossibly blue. Lake Pukaki, maybe, or Lake Tekapo — I’m not entirely sure, but it doesn’t matter. Its beauty is raw and overwhelming. The water reflects the heavens, mirroring clouds that drift lazily above, as if Earth and sky have become one seamless thing.

On the roadside, sheep graze lazily on golden hills, their wool fluttering in the breeze. A cyclist passes in the opposite direction, pedaling uphill with determination, his bright jacket a sharp contrast against the natural palette.

I slow down slightly as a single-lane bridge approaches, one of those iconic South Island crossings. A camper van coming the other way flashes its lights in thanks as I yield, and we exchange a wave — the kind of silent camaraderie that only road travelers share.

There are few other cars. Mostly it's just me, the road, and this vast, breathing wilderness. The silence inside the car is comforting, broken only by the soft hum of the engine and the occasional whisper of a breeze brushing past the windows.

Above all this, the sky — wide and infinite — stretches out like a canvas brushed with the faintest wisps of white. It feels like I’m driving not just through a country, but through a dream. Through the final pages of a story written by the Earth herself.

And in moments like this, as I steer gently around a curve and see yet another glacier-fed stream trickling beside the road, I feel it — the purity of the planet. Undisturbed. Untamed. Sacred. A last glimpse of what the world looked like before we carved it into cities.

This, I think, is what freedom feels like.
