My hands are gently gripping the steering wheel — the leather warm under my palms from the soft kiss of the sun through the windshield. One hand occasionally drifts away to lift a coffee cup from the console, the lid clicking softly as I sip, the aroma of roasted beans mixing with the cold, clean mountain air that seeps through a cracked window.

Outside, the road stretches ahead like a ribbon of asphalt unraveling through a cathedral of nature. This is the Icefields Parkway — a road carved through the raw heart of the Canadian Rockies. On either side, towering mountains loom with silent majesty, their jagged peaks crowned with ancient ice, the glaciers cascading down their flanks like frozen waterfalls captured mid-fall.

To the right, a lake suddenly appears — turquoise, impossibly blue, as if the earth has wept tears of sky into a stone basin. Its surface is still, like polished glass, mirroring the snowy peaks above. I slow down, caught in the silence of it all. It's the kind of beauty that doesn't shout — it whispers, and the whisper moves something deep inside you.

The road winds gently, and as I drive, each curve reveals a new wonder — pine forests thick and dark like velvet, herds of elk grazing by the roadside, their heads lifting slowly to watch as I pass. A soft mist clings to the valleys, making everything feel like a dream barely held together.

Through the windshield, the horizon is a painting in motion. Sunlight breaks through scattered clouds, spotlighting patches of the wilderness. A glacier looms to the left now — blue and ancient, groaning under its own weight. You can almost hear it breathe.

Inside the car, silence. No music, no words. Just the occasional soft hum of the engine, the crunch of gravel when I pull over, and the rhythmic tap of my turn signal. My breath fogs the window slightly as I exhale.

And suddenly — there it is.

A moment so full of grace it aches. The kind of moment that strips you bare. I stare out the side window at a place so vast, so wild, so untouched, that tears sting the corners of my eyes. I don't know if it's the mountains, the light, the sheer scale of it all — or something in me breaking open to let it in.

Maybe this is what it means to truly see.

To be small.

To be free.

To be fully, quietly alive.
