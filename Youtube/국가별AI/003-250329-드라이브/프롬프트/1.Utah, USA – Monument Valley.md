I am driving through the vast, open landscape of Monument Valley in Utah, USA. My hands are lightly gripping the steering wheel — the left one steady at about the 10 o'clock position, while the right hand occasionally lifts to check my phone for directions or to take a sip from a cold drink resting in the center console. The texture of the steering wheel feels slightly worn but firm, familiar beneath my fingers.

Outside the car, the scenery stretches endlessly in every direction. The sky is an enormous dome of blue, scattered with a few wispy clouds glowing under the afternoon sun. The air is dry and crisp. Through the windshield, I see the iconic red sandstone buttes rising dramatically from the desert floor — towering monoliths that seem to glow a deep orange-red in the sunlight. Their rugged edges cast long shadows over the dusty terrain.

The road ahead is a straight two-lane highway that cuts cleanly through the desert, stretching toward the horizon like a ribbon of black asphalt. There are few cars on the road — a couple of RVs in the distance, maybe a pickup truck passing in the opposite direction. Some are pulling over to the side of the road to take pictures.

On either side of the road, the land is flat and dry, dotted with sagebrush, low shrubs, and the occasional tumbleweed rolling gently with the breeze. Far off to the left, I catch a glimpse of a wild horse grazing near a fence line. A couple of tourists are standing beside their parked vehicle, pointing their phones up at the massive buttes, trying to capture the raw scale of it all.

Through the side windows, I can see the red dust rising in soft swirls from the shoulder of the road, stirred by the occasional gusts of wind. The sun casts a golden hue across everything — even my hands on the steering wheel seem to glow under the amber light.

The car interior is filled with a quiet hum — the sound of the engine, the gentle whoosh of the air conditioning, and faint music playing from the speakers. It feels peaceful, almost meditative, as the landscape slowly rolls by. The combination of motion, light, and sound creates a sense of deep solitude and awe. It's like driving through a painting — surreal, timeless, and deeply American.
