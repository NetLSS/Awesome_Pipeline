My hands grip the steering wheel firmly, the worn leather warm under my palms from the sun beating down through the windshield. My left hand stays steady, while my right occasionally releases its grip — sometimes to reach for my phone resting in the console, sometimes to sip cool water from a bottle, condensation beading down its side. The hum of the engine blends with the faint rattle of the vehicle over the rough desert road.

Through the dusty windshield, an endless stretch of ochre sand unfolds ahead of me. The road is narrow, partially paved and partially faded into the desert terrain, with small patches of gravel and sand scattered across it. On either side of the road, the desert stretches far and wide, glowing with a golden-orange hue under the brilliant Moroccan sun. Rippling dunes rise and fall like frozen waves, their edges sharp and sculpted by the wind.

To my left, a cluster of low adobe houses appears in the distance, their earthen walls blending almost seamlessly into the desert around them. Children play near the roadside, laughing, running barefoot, kicking up little puffs of dust with each step. A woman in a flowing indigo robe and headscarf walks gracefully, balancing a clay jug on her shoulder, casting a long shadow across the sand.

To my right, a caravan of camels plods slowly through the dunes, led by a Berber man in a bright blue turban. The camels sway gently, their feet padded and silent, leaving soft trails behind them. Occasionally, I spot palm trees clustered around a small oasis, their green fronds rustling in the dry breeze, like an emerald mirage in the golden sea.

The sky above is vast and endless — a deep, cloudless blue. The sunlight is sharp, casting crisp shadows and making everything shimmer slightly with heat. In the distance, the dunes seem to melt into the sky, the horizon a blur of gold and azure.

Cars occasionally pass by in the opposite direction — mostly rugged 4x4s coated with a fine layer of desert dust. Drivers give a friendly wave or a subtle nod, part of the unspoken camaraderie of travelers in this remote land.

Inside the car, it’s warm but peaceful. The soft hum of the air conditioner mingles with a faint melody playing on the radio — perhaps traditional Moroccan music, the rhythmic beat of drums and the haunting notes of a flute setting the mood of the journey.

As I drive deeper into the desert, time seems to stretch out, slow and fluid like the sands around me. The road, the dunes, the people — everything feels like a vivid dream, suspended in light and heat.
