My hands are resting on the steering wheel — one lightly gripping the smooth leather, the other occasionally lifting to take a sip of iced coffee or swipe at my phone for a song change. The hum of the engine blends with the gentle whisper of sea wind brushing against the side windows. Through the windshield, the late afternoon sun casts golden reflections on the hood, and beyond it, the road stretches and curves like a ribbon along Jeju’s coastline.

To my right, the ocean glistens — deep blue with threads of silver, waves lazily tumbling toward black volcanic rocks that jut out like old sentinels. Small fishing boats bob in the distance, their faded paint speaking of years at sea. On the left side, low stone walls, made from Jeju’s signature basalt, line the roadside. Behind them, tangerine trees sway gently, their bright orange fruit catching the light like little lanterns.

I pass by weathered signboards of seaside cafés and old 국밥집 (gukbap restaurants) — their names in faded Hangul evoke a warmth I remember from childhood. “해녀밥상,” “옛날국밥,” and “제주감성식당” — these names are more than just businesses. They echo with familiar voices: the soft Jeju dialect of an old ajumma calling, “들어와유~ 국밥 금방 나와요!” It wraps around me like a blanket.

Every now and then, a gentle voice on the radio speaks in a tone that feels like home — like the sound of my mother calling me in from play as the sun dipped behind Hallasan. I drive on, passing groups of schoolchildren walking with laughter, a scooter buzzing by, and elderly couples sitting on benches facing the sea, sharing quiet moments.

The smell of sea salt, wildflowers, and distant grilled mackerel sneaks into the car through a crack in the window. And as I wind down a quieter stretch of road lined with camellia trees, my heart softens. The sky is beginning to blush with pinks and purples, and I can feel the island slowing down with the sun.

I take a turn off the main road, heading toward a quieter inland path I used to ride with my father. The road is narrower here, flanked by barley fields and old stone houses with blue-tiled roofs. I lower the window fully now. The air smells like grass, salt, and memory.

Tonight, I want nothing more than to find a spot close to home — maybe a small lookout point or an old trailhead where I used to walk. Somewhere quiet, just before night fully wraps Jeju in navy velvet. I’ll sit there in silence, letting the sound of waves and wind hold me gently… ending the day not with noise, but with a whisper — one that says:

"You’re home."
