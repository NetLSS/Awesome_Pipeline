My hands are gently gripping the steering wheel—my left hand resting steadily at the 10 o’clock position, while my right hand occasionally shifts between the wheel, a cold iced coffee in the cup holder, and my phone resting on the dashboard mount, just glancing at it for GPS directions when needed. The leather of the steering wheel feels warm from the sun that’s been shining through the windshield.

Outside the window, the view is absolutely breathtaking. To my left, rugged cliffs drop steeply into the vast, endless Pacific Ocean. The sunlight dances on the surface of the water, turning it into a mosaic of shimmering blues and silvers. Waves crash rhythmically against the rocky shore far below.

To my right, towering hills covered in dry golden grass and scattered with windswept cypress trees rise sharply, creating a dramatic contrast to the sea. Every now and then, a narrow pullout or a scenic overlook appears, with a few parked cars and people standing by the guardrails, taking photos or simply staring in awe at the view.

The road itself is a narrow, winding ribbon of asphalt, hugging the cliffs tightly. It curves and dips with the contours of the land, requiring careful attention. Sometimes, I pass over small arched bridges that connect two cliffs like a delicate thread, the most iconic being the Bixby Creek Bridge—majestic, graceful, and framed perfectly by the surrounding landscape.

Other cars pass me now and then—some tourists in rental SUVs, some vintage convertibles with their tops down, hair blowing in the salty breeze. Cyclists hug the edge of the road, their neon gear flashing in the sunlight. I spot a motorcyclist ahead, gliding smoothly along the curves like they’ve done this ride a hundred times.

Occasionally, the scent of the ocean mixes with the crisp, earthy smell of pine trees that line some of the more forested stretches. The sun filters through the occasional patches of coastal fog, casting soft beams of light across the road.

The whole experience feels like a moving painting—part wild, part serene, and deeply alive.
