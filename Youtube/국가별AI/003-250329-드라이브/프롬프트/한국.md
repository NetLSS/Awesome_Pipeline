I’m sitting in the driver’s seat, both hands resting lightly on the steering wheel. My left hand grips the wheel steadily at the 10 o'clock position, while my right hand occasionally leaves the wheel — either to glance at my phone resting in the cupholder, or to take a sip from a paper coffee cup nestled beside it. The interior of the car is familiar and clean: the dashboard is dark gray, with soft sunlight reflecting slightly off its surface. The air conditioning hums softly, blending with the muted sounds of traffic outside.

Through the front windshield, I see a typical South Korean street — wide and neatly paved, with white lane markings that shimmer faintly in the daylight. To the left, a line of compact cars and SUVs slowly inches forward, their brake lights flickering red now and then. On my right, the sidewalk is lined with tidy rows of trees, their branches swaying gently in the spring breeze. People walk briskly by, some dressed in business attire, others in casual clothes, all absorbed in their own routines. A delivery motorbike weaves carefully between cars, its rider wearing a bright yellow helmet and a large insulated box strapped to the back.

Storefronts flash past on the right — a mix of convenience stores, cafés, and local eateries. Bright Korean signs in Hangul catch my eye: "김밥천국", "이디야커피", "CU". I catch a glimpse of a young couple exiting a bakery, holding a small paper bag and laughing together as they cross the street at a zebra crossing.

Traffic lights hang overhead, suspended from thick black wires. One turns yellow, then red, and I gently press down on the brake pedal. The car slows smoothly to a stop. I glance in the rearview mirror — a white sedan pulls up behind me. I can see the driver bobbing his head slightly, probably to music.

The sky outside is bright but slightly overcast, with soft clouds diffusing the sunlight. The light is gentle, not harsh. The road stretches ahead, curving slightly to the left, disappearing between rows of mid-rise apartment buildings in the distance.

As I wait for the light to turn green, I reach again for my drink, take a small sip, and exhale. A calm, steady moment, surrounded by the ever-moving rhythm of the city.
