I'm gripping the steering wheel with my left hand — it's firm but relaxed. The textured surface of the wheel feels familiar beneath my fingers, slightly warm from the sun filtering through the windshield. Occasionally, I lift my right hand to sip from a stainless steel travel mug — the coffee inside is still steaming faintly, giving off that rich, earthy aroma. At other times, I glance down quickly at my phone resting in the cup holder, checking the route or skipping to the next song in my playlist.

Out the windshield, the road stretches ahead like a winding ribbon, narrow and hugged by low stone walls and wild hedges. The asphalt is uneven in places, patched here and there, but it only adds to the charm of the drive. To the left, the North Sea glimmers in the distance, its waves catching the light like scattered silver coins. The sky above is a vast canvas of soft gray clouds and sharp blue patches, constantly shifting as the coastal wind dances through them.

On the right, the rugged highlands rise in gentle slopes and jagged peaks, covered in heather and mossy greens. Tiny cottages with slate roofs dot the hillsides like forgotten toys, smoke curling lazily from chimneys. Sheep roam freely near the road — their woolly coats dirt-streaked but charming, and they glance up lazily as the car passes.

Pedestrians appear now and then — hikers with backpacks and trekking poles, sometimes pausing to take in the view or snap a photo. Cyclists in bright gear push their way up the slopes, their breath visible in the cool air. Occasionally, another car approaches, and we both slow to a crawl on the single-track road, exchanging a polite wave as we pass at the nearest lay-by.

The side windows show a blur of wild beauty: tufts of golden grass bending in the breeze, clusters of purple thistle, and the sudden sparkle of a hidden loch just beyond a bend. Sometimes a burst of sunshine pierces the clouds, bathing everything in a golden glow that makes the landscape feel timeless — as if you're driving through a dream shaped by earth and myth.

In the distance, I spot a sign for a scenic overlook — a chance to pull over, stretch my legs, and breathe in the raw, salty air of northern Scotland. But for now, I keep driving, the gentle hum of the engine mixing with the wind and distant cry of seabirds, immersed in this ever-changing painting of sky, sea, and stone.
