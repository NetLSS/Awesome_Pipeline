You're holding the steering wheel with your left hand — your fingers lightly gripping the leather-wrapped rim, the texture slightly worn in spots from past drives. Your right hand occasionally lets go to reach for your phone resting in the cup holder, or to sip from a warm can of vending machine coffee that still releases faint wisps of steam. The interior of the car smells faintly of roasted beans and cool, clean air.

Through the windshield, an open landscape stretches before you — wide, undulating hills painted in soft shades of green, brown, and gold. The road winds gently between these hills like a ribbon, curving with a natural grace. The asphalt is smooth, flanked on both sides by neatly plowed farmland, some of it still frosted at the edges with remnants of morning dew or light snow. Patches of vivid yellow rapeseed flowers bloom in the distance, and some fields are freshly tilled, the dark soil rich and earthy.

To your right, tall poplar trees stand like silent sentinels, their branches bare and still in the late-morning calm. Occasionally, you pass a small wooden farmhouse with white smoke rising from the chimney, hinting at someone making breakfast inside.

Out your left window, a few cyclists pedal leisurely along a countryside path, their colorful jackets vivid against the muted tones of early spring. A couple of local cars pass by — mostly compact vans and kei cars, politely sticking to the speed limit. Everyone drives calmly here, as if the land itself encourages a slower, more mindful pace.

Above, the sky is wide and pale blue with scattered clouds drifting lazily, casting slow-moving shadows across the hills. The sunlight filters in through the windshield, dappled slightly by the faint smudges and dust on the glass. You squint a little, but it’s not harsh — the light is soft, almost golden, giving everything a postcard-like glow.

The air outside looks crisp and pure, and even through the closed windows, there's a sense of vastness, of space and silence. Somewhere in the distance, you can just make out the faint outline of the Tokachidake mountain range — still snow-capped and majestic — towering like a quiet guardian over the landscape.

The only sound in the car is the gentle hum of the engine and the rhythmic swish of the tires on the road, occasionally joined by the soft clink of your drink or the buzz of a notification on your phone.

And through all of this — the serene landscape, the quiet roads, the soft colors — you feel a deep calm. You're not just driving. You're moving through beauty.
