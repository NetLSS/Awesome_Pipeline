I’m behind the wheel, my left hand resting steadily on the textured, slightly warm steering wheel, while my right hand occasionally reaches down to grab a bottle of cold iced coffee from the cupholder or taps on my phone screen for a quick glance at the map—though I make sure to keep my eyes mostly on the road.

The sun is shining through the windshield, casting a soft golden hue over the dashboard. Outside the window, the iconic orange-red towers of the Golden Gate Bridge rise ahead like sentinels in the morning light, their massive steel cables forming graceful curves that stretch into the sky.

The bridge beneath me rumbles gently with the rhythm of traffic. I can feel the slight vibration in the steering wheel and through the floor of the car as tires hum over the metal grating in certain parts. The ocean breeze is visible in the way flags flutter on the bridge’s edge, and the cool salty air slips in through the slightly cracked window, carrying a refreshing chill.

To the right, beyond the reddish-orange beams, the sparkling blue waters of the San Francisco Bay expand far into the distance. Boats move like slow brushstrokes across the surface. On the far side of the bay, the hills of Marin County are dusted with trees and low-lying houses, basking in soft morning mist. Seagulls glide effortlessly above, their white wings catching flashes of sunlight.

To the left, the cityscape of San Francisco stretches out—rows of tightly packed buildings climb the hills like stacked blocks, and the distant silhouette of the Transamerica Pyramid pierces the sky. Cars pass by me—some in a rush, some in no hurry at all. A cyclist in bright neon gear pedals in the designated bike lane, keeping pace with the traffic.

I feel the sensation of movement—smooth, steady—punctuated by the occasional stop-and-go of traffic. The rhythmic sound of turn signals clicking, tires rolling, and distant horns all blend into the ambient noise of the drive. Overhead, the sun filters through patches of morning fog clinging to the tops of the bridge towers, giving everything a dreamlike, cinematic quality.

And as I continue across the bridge, the world behind the glass feels alive and vast, and I am just passing through it—one frame at a time.
