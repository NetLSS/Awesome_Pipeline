Selfless work leads to silence, because when working without ego, there is no need to ask for help. Being indifferent to the outcomes, one is prepared to work willingly even with the least adequate means. It does not matter whether one is highly talented or well-qualified. One does not seek recognition or assistance from others. Simply doing what needs to be done, entrusting success and failure to the unknown, because everything is brought about by countless factors, and your effort is merely one among them.
