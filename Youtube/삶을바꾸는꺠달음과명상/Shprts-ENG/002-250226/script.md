What is Meditation and What Are Its Benefits?

While you are a beginner, you may not know which formal meditation or prayer will suit you best.However, for those who seek reality, there is only one meditation: a strict refusal to entertain thoughts in your mind.Simply escaping from thoughts is meditation.

How Do You Do It?

Begin by letting your thoughts flow freely while observing them.That very act of observation slows down the pace of your mind until eventually, your mind comes to a complete halt.Once your mind has become calm,  maintain that calmness.Do not grow weary of the peace; remain in it and delve even deeper into it.
