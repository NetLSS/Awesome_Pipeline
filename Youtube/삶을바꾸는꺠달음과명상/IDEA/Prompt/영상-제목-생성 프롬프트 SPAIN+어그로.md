I have created a YouTube video. The script is as follows:

Script

[Script]

This YouTube channel operates in Spain. The title, description, etc. are all in Spanish.

Request 1

Now, please write the title and description for this video. Include appropriate hashtags in both the title and description.

The title should be accessible to the general public, even those unfamiliar with meditation and enlightenment. A curiosity-stimulating title would be great.

Request 2

Please recommend text for the thumbnail image. The text should consist of three lines as follows:

Include notable phrases or summaries from the script rather than overly obvious titles.

[Main Title]

[Sub Title 1]

[Sub Title 2]

Note that Sub Titles 1 and 2 should be related to the Main Title.

Request 3

Please provide a few recommendations for titles, descriptions, and thumbnail texts that are highly engaging and likely to attract clicks.
