Below is the script I will use for the video. It's in Korean, so please translate it into Japanese accordingly.

If a sentence gets too long in the transcript, please add an apostrophe or line break. (I don't know Japanese well enough to know where to break it)

I have created a YouTube video. The script is as follows:

Formula for Increasing Views by 10x

1️⃣ Use Extreme Numbers

2️⃣ Provoke with Reverse Thinking

3️⃣ Leave Curiosity Unfinished

4️⃣ Specifically Provoke a Target Audience

5️⃣ Utilize the Forbidden Format (“Don’t Do ~”)

6️⃣ Add a Time Limit (Soon to Be Paid)

1️⃣ Use Extreme Numbers

People are used to common numbers (3 things, 5 things) and tend to ignore them.

Extreme numbers that break common sense, like "Save 90% of Your Salary," instantly grab attention and quickly boost views.

✅ Real Method That Led to Saving 90% of My Salary

2️⃣ Provoke with Reverse Thinking

People predict the outcome of familiar titles (e.g., Secrets to Success) and don’t click.

But suggesting an unexpected result, like "Why You Can’t Succeed," sparks curiosity and increases click rates.

❌ Collection of Habits for Success

✅ The One Thing People Who Can’t Succeed Have in Common

3️⃣ Leave Curiosity Unfinished

If the title reveals everything, it fails to drive clicks.

"Lost 8kg Doing This Exercise" shares the result but hides the method, keeping curiosity alive so people can’t resist clicking.

❌ Recommended Weight Loss Exercises

✅ Lost 8kg in a Month Doing This Exercise

4️⃣ Specifically Provoke a Target Audience

Broad titles feel vague to everyone and don’t give a reason to click.

Targeting a specific group’s pain point, like "Newbies, Watch This Before Quitting," provokes them into clicking immediately.

❌ Stress Management for Office Workers

✅ If You’re a Newbie, Please Watch This Before Quitting

5️⃣ Utilize the Forbidden Format (“Don’t Do ~”)

People are more sensitive to avoiding losses than chasing gains.

Using loss-avoidance psychology, like "Reasons You’ll Fail," reliably boosts click rates.

❌ How to Invest in Stocks

✅ Top 3 Reasons Beginners Fail at Stocks

6️⃣ Add a Time Limit (Soon to Be Paid)

Instead of “I’ll watch later,” emphasizing loss with "Watch Now or Pay Later" creates urgency and drives instant clicks.

Especially on YouTube, immediate clicks help with algorithm recommendations.
