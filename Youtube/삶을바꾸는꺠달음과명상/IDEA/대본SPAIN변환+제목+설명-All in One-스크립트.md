Below is the script I will use for the video. It's in Korean, so please translate it into Spanish accordingly.

If a sentence gets too long in the transcript, please add an apostrophe or line break. (I don't know Spanish well enough to know where to break it)

I have created a YouTube video. The script is as follows:

## Transcript

[script]

## Request

This YouTube channel operates in Spain. The title, description, etc. are all in Spanish.

## Request 1

Now, please write the title and description for this video. Include appropriate hashtags in both the title and description.

The title should be accessible to the general public, even those unfamiliar with meditation and enlightenment. A curiosity-stimulating title would be great.

## Request 2

Please recommend text for the thumbnail image. The text should consist of three lines as follows:

Include notable phrases or summaries from the script rather than overly obvious titles.

[Main Title]

[Sub Title 1]

[Sub Title 2]

Note that Sub Titles 1 and 2 should be related to the Main Title.

## Request 3

Please provide a few recommendations for titles, descriptions, and thumbnail texts that are highly engaging and likely to attract clicks.

## Request 4

I would like to add tags for content related to the transcript to help the search algorithm. For example, please create tags related to the keywords and other words with the same meaning, dialect, English, etc. separated by commas (,). Please narrow it down to 10 key tags.
