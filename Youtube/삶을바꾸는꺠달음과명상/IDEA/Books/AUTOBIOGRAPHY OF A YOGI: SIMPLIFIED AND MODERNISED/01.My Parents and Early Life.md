My Parents and Early Life

The unique qualities of Indian culture have always been a deep search for ultimate truths and the special bond between a teacher Wand a disciple. My own journey brought me to a sage who lived a life much like Christ. His life was so beautiful and inspiring that it became timeless. He was one of India's great spiritual leaders, who remain its true treasure. These masters appear in every generation and have protected their country from the downfall faced by ancient civilizations like Babylon and Egypt.
My earliest memories seem to connect with the unusual details of a life I lived in the past. I clearly remember moments from a far-off time when I was a yogi. 1 Amidst the snowy peaks of the Himalayas, I often found myself reflecting on the past. These reflections, in some mysterious way, also gave me a sense of the future. I could not forget the struggles of my early childhood. I clearly remembered how helpless I felt as a baby, unable to walk or speak as I wished. This frustration often made me feel restless. I silently prayed, wishing I could overcome my physical weakness. My strong emotions found an outlet in forming words, even though they came from many languages As I slowly adjusted to my surroundings, the Bengali words spoken by my family began to feel familiar. It's amazing how a baby's mind works—it seems simple to adults, focused only on toys and small things like toes, but it's so much more.
My frustration with my uncooperative body often led to crying spells. I still remember how confused my family was when they couldn't understand my distress. But alongside these difficult moments, I also recall happy memories: my mother's loving touch, my first faltering words, and my wobbly steps. These little achievements, though often forgotten, are the foundation of self-confidence.
My ability to remember far back into my childhood isn't unique. Many yogis are said to retain a sense of self through the dramatic transitions between life and death. If humans were only their physical bodies, then losing the body would mean the end of identity. But if the prophets through the ages spoke the truth, then humans are more than just bodies. The essence of who we are is something deeper, something beyond the senses.
though uncommon, clear memories of infancy are not unheard of. In my travels, I have met honest men and women who shared similar early recollections. I was born in the last decade of the 19th century, spending my first eight years in Gorakhpur, a town in the northeastern part of India. It was my birthplace in the United Provin
- were a family of eight children— four boys and four girls. I, Mukunda Lal Ghosh, was the second son and the fourth child. Both my father and mother were Bengalis, belonging to the kshatriya caste.4 Both of them had a saintly nature. Their love for each other was calm, respectful, and never playful or silly. Together, they create peaceful and loving home for their eight children, even though life around them was often noisy and chaotic.
Father, Bhagabati Charan Ghosh, was kind and serious, but he could also be strict. We, as children, loved him deeply but always treated him with great respect. He was a brilliant mathematician and thinker, using his intellect to guide him in life. On the other hand, Mother was full of love and warmth. She taught us everything through kindness. After her death, Father became softer and showed more tenderness. At times, his gaze reminded me of Mother's.

나의 부모와 유년 시절

인도 문화의 고유한 특성은 언제나 궁극적인 진리에 대한 깊은 탐구와 스승과 제자 사이의 특별한 유대감에 있었다. 나의 여정 역시 그리스도와 같은 삶을 살았던 한 성자를 만나게 하였다. 그의 삶은 너무나 아름답고 감동적이어서 시대를 초월한 것이 되었다. 그는 인도의 위대한 영적 지도자 중 한 명으로, 그 존재 자체가 인도의 진정한 보물이었다. 이러한 스승들은 매 세대마다 등장하며, 바빌론이나 이집트와 같은 고대 문명들이 맞이한 몰락으로부터 조국을 지켜왔다.

내 가장 이른 기억들은 내가 과거에 살았던 특별한 삶의 세부 사항들과 연결되어 있는 듯하다. 나는 멀리 떨어진 시절, 요기였던 시절의 순간들을 또렷이 기억한다. 히말라야의 눈 덮인 봉우리들 속에서, 나는 자주 과거를 되돌아보았다. 이 회상은 어떤 신비한 방식으로 미래에 대한 감각도 함께 주었다. 어린 시절의 고통을 잊을 수 없었다. 말하거나 걷고 싶어도 마음대로 할 수 없었던 아기 시절의 무기력함이 분명히 기억났다. 그 좌절감은 종종 나를 불안하게 만들었다. 나는 조용히 기도하며, 육체적인 약함을 극복할 수 있기를 바랐다. 내 강렬한 감정은 언어를 통해 분출되었고, 그것은 여러 언어에서 비롯된 말들이었다. 점차 주변 환경에 익숙해지면서, 가족들이 사용하는 벵골어가 친숙하게 느껴지기 시작했다. 아기의 마음이 어떻게 작동하는지 참으로 놀랍다. 어른들에게는 단순하고 장난감이나 발가락 같은 작은 것에만 관심 있는 듯 보이지만, 그 이상이다.

내 몸이 말을 듣지 않는 것에 대한 좌절감은 종종 울음으로 이어졌다. 가족들이 내 괴로움을 이해하지 못해 당황해하던 모습도 아직 기억난다. 하지만 그러한 힘든 순간들과 함께, 나는 기쁜 기억들도 떠올린다. 어머니의 다정한 손길, 첫 마디의 서툰 말, 흔들리며 걷던 첫 걸음. 이 작고 자주 잊히는 성취들이야말로 자존감의 토대가 된다.

어린 시절의 기억을 깊이 간직하는 능력은 나만의 것이 아니다. 많은 요기들이 삶과 죽음이라는 극적인 전환 속에서도 자아의식을 유지한다고 전해진다. 만약 인간이 단지 육체에 불과하다면, 육체를 잃는 것은 곧 정체성의 끝을 의미할 것이다. 하지만 시대를 초월한 예언자들이 말한 바가 진실이라면, 인간은 단지 육체만이 아니다. 인간 존재의 본질은 감각 너머에 있는 어떤 더 깊은 것이다.

비록 흔하지는 않지만, 유아기의 선명한 기억은 드문 일도 아니다. 여행 중에 나는 그러한 이른 시절의 기억을 공유하는 정직한 사람들을 만난 적이 있다. 나는 19세기 마지막 10년 동안 태어나, 인도 북동부의 고라크푸르라는 마을에서 처음 8년을 보냈다. 이곳은 연합주에서의 나의 출생지였다. 우리는 네 명의 아들과 네 명의 딸, 총 여덟 남매였다. 나는 무쿤다 랄 고쉬, 둘째 아들이자 넷째 자식이었다. 부모님 두 분 다 벵골인이며 크샤트리야 계급 출신이었다. 두 분 모두 성스러운 성품을 지니셨다. 두 사람 사이의 사랑은 평온하고 존중에 가득 차 있었으며, 결코 가볍거나 장난스러운 것이 아니었다. 비록 주변의 삶은 소란스럽고 혼란스러웠지만, 그들은 여덟 자녀를 위한 평화롭고 사랑이 넘치는 가정을 함께 만들어주셨다.

아버지, 바가바티 차란 고쉬는 친절하고 진지한 분이었지만, 때로는 엄격하시기도 하였다. 우리는 자녀로서 그를 깊이 사랑했지만 항상 큰 존경심으로 대하였다. 그는 뛰어난 수학자이자 사상가로, 삶의 길을 지혜로 이끌어 나가셨다. 반면 어머니는 사랑과 따뜻함으로 가득하셨다. 어머니는 모든 것을 친절함으로 우리에게 가르치셨다. 어머니가 돌아가신 후, 아버지는 더욱 부드러워지셨고, 때때로 그의 눈빛은 어머니를 떠올리게 하였다.

In Mother's presence, we were first introduced to the scriptures. She used stories from the Mahabharata and Ramayana Lito teach us lessons and discipline us when needed. Learning and discipline went hand in hand with her.
Every afternoon, Mother dressed us carefully so we could greet Father when he returned from work. He had an important job, like a vice-president, at the Bengal-Nagpur Railway, a big company in India. His job required him to travel a lot, so we moved to different cities during my childhood.
Mother was generous to the needy, always ready to help others. Father was kind too but also practical about money. Once, Mother spent more on helping the poor in two weeks than Father earned in a month.
"All I ask is that you keep your generosity within limits," Father said gently. Even this mild criticism upset Mother. She called for a carriage without explaining anything to us and said, "Goodbye; I am going to my mother's home." It was a classic response!
We were shocked and started crying. Luckily, our uncle arrived and gave Father some wise advice. After Father said a few kind words, Mother dismissed the carriage, and everything was back to normal. That was the only disagreement I ever saw between my parents.
I also remember a conversation that showed their differences.
"Please give me ten rupees for a poor woman who just came to our house," Mother said with her usual warm smile.
"Why ten rupees? One is enough," Father replied, explaining, "When my father and grandparents passed away suddenly, I experienced poverty for the first time. My breakfast before walking miles to school was just a small banana. Later, at university, I asked a wealthy judge for one rupee per month. He refused, saying even a rupee is important."
Mother, with her quick logic, replied, "You still feel bitter about that one rupee. Do you want this woman to feel the same way about your refusal of ten rupees?"
"You win!" Father said with a smile and handed over the money, adding, "Give it to her with my good will."
Father often said "No" at first to any new idea or request. His cautious nature made him think carefully before agreeing to something. But he was always fair. If I supported my requests with good reasons, he usually agreed, whether it was for a vacation or a new motorcycle.

어머니의 존재 안에서 우리는 처음으로 경전을 접하였다. 어머니는 마하바라타와 라마야나의 이야기들을 통해 우리에게 교훈을 주고, 필요할 때에는 훈육의 도구로 사용하셨다. 어머니에게는 학문과 훈육이 언제나 함께였다.

매일 오후, 어머니는 우리가 아버지를 맞이할 수 있도록 정성스럽게 옷을 입혀 주셨다. 아버지는 인도의 대기업인 벵갈-나그푸르 철도회사에서 부사장에 해당하는 중요한 직책을 맡고 계셨다. 아버지의 일은 출장이 잦았기에, 우리는 어린 시절 여러 도시로 이사를 다니며 살았다.

어머니는 어려운 이웃들에게 매우 관대하셨고, 항상 도울 준비가 되어 있는 분이었다. 아버지도 친절하셨지만, 돈에 대해서는 실용적인 태도를 지니고 계셨다. 한 번은 어머니가 가난한 이웃들을 돕는 데 2주 만에 아버지의 한 달치 월급보다 더 많은 돈을 쓰신 적도 있었다.

'내 바람은 단지 당신의 관대함이 어느 정도 선을 지키는 것이오.' 아버지는 부드럽게 말씀하셨다. 그러나 이 온화한 충고조차 어머니를 불편하게 만들었다. 어머니는 아무런 설명 없이 마차를 부르시더니, '잘 있거라. 나는 어머니 댁으로 간다.'라고 말씀하셨다. 참으로 전형적인 어머니다운 반응이었다.

우리는 충격을 받아 울기 시작하였다. 다행히 삼촌이 도착하여 아버지께 현명한 조언을 드렸다. 아버지가 몇 마디 따뜻한 말을 건네시자, 어머니는 마차를 돌려보내셨고 모든 것이 다시 평온해졌다. 그것이 내가 본 부모님 사이의 유일한 다툼이었다.

나는 또한 부모님의 차이를 잘 보여주는 대화를 기억한다.

'방금 우리 집에 찾아온 가난한 여인을 위해 10루피만 주시겠어요?' 어머니는 평소처럼 따뜻한 미소로 말씀하셨다.

'왜 10루피나 필요한가요? 1루피면 충분하오.' 아버지는 이렇게 답하시며 설명을 이어가셨다. '내 아버지와 조부모님이 갑작스레 돌아가신 후, 나는 처음으로 가난을 경험했소. 학교까지 몇 마일을 걸어가기 전, 아침으로 바나나 하나를 먹는 것이 전부였소. 나중에 대학 시절, 나는 부유한 판사에게 한 달에 1루피만 달라고 부탁했지만 그는 거절했소. 그에게는 1루피조차 아까운 것이었지.'

어머니는 빠른 논리로 답하셨다. '지금도 그 1루피에 대한 서운함을 갖고 계시잖아요. 당신도 이 여인이 10루피를 거절당한 일을 그렇게 기억하게 만들고 싶으세요?'

'당신이 이겼소!' 아버지는 미소를 지으며 돈을 건네시며 덧붙이셨다. '그녀에게 내 선의와 함께 전달해 주시오.'

아버지는 새로운 생각이나 요청에 대해 처음에는 항상 '안 된다'고 하셨다. 조심스러운 성격 탓에 어떤 일에도 쉽게 동의하지 않으셨다. 그러나 아버지는 언제나 공정하셨다. 내가 충분한 이유를 들어 요청을 설명하면, 그것이 휴가든 새 오토바이든 대부분 허락해 주셨다.

Father was very strict with us when we were young, but he was even stricter with himself. He lived a simple life, never going to theaters or indulging in luxuries. Instead, he found joy in spiritual practices and reading the Bhagavad Gita le Shunning all luxuries, he would wear the same old pair of shoes until they were completely worn out. While his sons bought cars when they became popular, Father was always satisfied with taking the trolley car to the office every day. He never cared about saving money just to gain power. Once, after setting up the Calcutta Urban Bank, he chose not to take any shares for himself. He only wanted to serve the community in his free time.
Years after Father retired with a pension, an English accountant came to review the financial records of the Bengal-Nagpur Railway Company. The accountant was shocked to find that Father had never claimed overdue bonuses.
"He did the work of three men!" the accountant told the company. "He is owed 125,000 rupees (about $41,250) in back pay." The company gave Father a check for the full amount. He thought so little of it that he never mentioned it to the family. Much later, my youngest brother Bishnu noticed a large deposit on a bank statement and asked him about it.
"Why be excited about money?" Father replied. "The person who aims for balance in life is neither overjoyed by gain nor upset by loss. Everyone is born into this world with nothing and leaves with nothing.
Early in their marriage, my parents became disciples of a great spiritual teacher, Lahiri Mahasaya of Benares. This connection deepened Father's natural simplicity. Mother once admitted to my eldest sister Roma, "Your father and I live as husband and wife only once a year, and only to have children." Father first met Lahiri Mahasaya through Abinash Babu, an employee at the Gorakhpur office of the Bengal-Nagpur Railway. Abinash often told me fascinating stories about many Indian saints. He always ended with praise for the greatness of his own guru.
"Did you ever hear about the unusual way your father became a disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya?" Abinash once asked me.
One lazy summer afternoon, as we sat together in the garden of my home, he shared the story. I eagerly shook my head, smiling as I waited to hear more.
"Years ago, before you were born," he began, "I asked your father, who was my boss, to give me a week off from work in Gorakhpur so I could visit my guru in Benares. Your father laughed at my request.
'Are you planning to become a religious fanatic?' he asked me. 'If you want to get ahead in life, focus on your work!
"That day, as I walked home through the woods, feeling sad, I saw your father riding in a palanquin. He stopped, dismissed his servants, and walked beside me. Trying to cheer me up, he spoke about the importance of worldly success. But I barely listened. All I could think was, 'Lahiri Mahasaya! I must see you!" Our journey led us to the edge of a peaceful field. The late afternoon sun cast golden rays on the tall, rippling wild grass. We stopped to admire the beauty. Suddenly, just a few yards away, the form of my great guru appeared in the field Is
'Bhagabati, you are too hard on your employee!' His voice was clear and strong, ringing in our surprised ears. Just as suddenly as he had appeared, he vanished. Overwhelmed, I dropped to my knees and cried out, 'Lahiri Mahasaya! Lahiri Mahasaya!' Your father stood frozen in shock for several moments.

"After a while, your father said, 'Abinash, not only do I give you permission to go, but I will also leave for Benares tomorrow. I must meet this great Lahiri Mahasaya, who can appear at will to help you! I will take my wife, and we will ask him to guide us on his spiritual path. Will you take us to him?'
'Of course. I felt joy as my prayer was miraculously answered and everything turned in our favor.
"The next evening, your parents and I boarded a train to Benares. The following day, we traveled by horse cart and then walked through narrow lanes to reach my guru's quiet home. When we entered his small parlor, we bowed before him. He sat in his usual lotus posture, calm and serene. His sharp eyes blinked as he looked straight at your father.
"Bhagabati, you are too hard on your employee!' He repeated the same words he had spoken in the Gorakhpur field two days earlier. Then he added, Tam glad you allowed Abinash to visit me, and that you and your wife came with him'
"To their delight, he initiated your parents into the spiritual practice of Kriya Yoga.2 From that day on, your father and I became close friends, bound by our shared experience of the vision. Lahiri Mahasaya took a special interest in your birth, blessing your life to be connected to his. His blessings never fail.
"Lahiri Mahasaya left this world shortly after I was born. His picture, in an ornate frame, was always on our family altar, no matter where Father's job took us. Every morning and evening, Mother and I meditated before a small shrine we created. We offered flowers dipped in fragrant sandalwood paste and burned incense as a sign of devotion. Together, we honored the divine presence fully expressed in Lahiri Mahasaya.
"His picture had a powerful effect on my life. As I grew older, I felt more connected to him. During meditation, his image often seemed to come alive, stepping out of the frame to sit before me. When I tried to touch his glowing feet, he would turn back into the picture. As I moved from childhood to boyhood, he became more than just an image in a frame. He became a real and guiding presence in my life.
"In moments of difficulty or confusion, I prayed to him and always felt his comforting guidance. At first, I was sad that he was no longer physically alive. But as I came to understand his ever-present spirit, I no longer grieved. He often told his disciples, 'Why come to see my bones and flesh, when I am always within the reach of your spiritual sight?"
At the age of eight, I experienced a miraculous healing through the photograph of Lahiri Mahasaya. This event deeply strengthened my love and devotion. While staying at our family estate in Ichapur, Bengal, I fell gravely ill with Asiatic cholera. The doctors could do nothing to help me, and my condition seemed hopeless.
At my bedside, my mother frantically pointed to Lahiri Mahasaya's picture on the wall above me.
"Bow to him in your mind!" she urged, knowing I was too weak to lift my hands. "If you truly show devotion and mentally kneel before him, your life will be saved!"

---

Ilooked at the photograph and suddenly saw a blinding light envelop my body and the room. Instantly, my nausea and other severe symptoms disappeared, and I felt completely well. With newfound strength, I bent over to touch my mother's feet, grateful for her unwavering faith in her guru. My mother, overwhelmed, pressed her head repeatedly to the small picture.
"O Omnipresent Master, I thank you for healing my son with your light!"
I realized she had also seen the luminous blaze that had healed me from what was usually a fatal illness.
One of my most treasured possessions is that very photograph, given to my father by Lahiri Mahasaya himself. The picture holds a sacred energy and has an incredible story behind it. My father's brother disciple, Kali Kumar Roy, told me the story.
Lahiri Mahasaya disliked being photographed. Once, despite his protests, a group picture was taken with him and some of his disciples, including Kali Kumar Roy. However, when the photo was developed, the disciples' images were clear, but Lahiri Mahasaya's spot was blank. This strange occurrence became widely discussed.
Later, a determined student and skilled photographer, Ganga Dhar Babu, decided to try again. He confidently set up his equipment as the guru sat in a lotus posture on a wooden bench. He carefully exposed twelve plates, but each one showed only the bench and screen—Lahiri Mahasaya's image was missing Heartbroken and humbled, Ganga Dhar Babu went to his guru. After hours of silence, Lahiri Mahasaya finally spoke:
"I am Spirit. Can your camera capture the omnipresent Invisible?"
Ganga Dhar Babu, filled with devotion, replied, "I understand it cannot. But I still long for a picture of the physical form where, to my limited eyes, that Spirit resides." Lahiri Mahasaya agreed to pose again the next morning. This time, his sacred image appeared clearly on the plate. That photo became the only one of him, as he never posed again.
The photograph, included in this book, shows Lahiri Mahasaya's serene and universal features. His slight smile reflects divine joy. His eyes, half open and half closed, seem to balance the outer world and inner spiritual focus. Though he was unconcerned with earthly matters, he was always aware of the needs of spiritual seekers Soon after my healing, I had a profound spiritual vision. One morning, as I sat on my bed, I fell into deep thought.
"What lies behind the darkness of closed eyes?" I wondered.
Suddenly, a brilliant light filled my inner vision. I saw divine figures- saints in meditation- appearing like tiny cinema images on a radiant screen within my forehead.

---

"Who are you?" I asked aloud.
"We are the Himalayan yogis," came the celestial reply. Their voices thrilled my heart.
"I want to go to the Himalayas and be like you!" I exclaimed. The vision faded, but the radiant light expanded infinitely in silvery waves.
"What is this glorious light?" I asked.
"I am Iswara. 101 I am Light," came a gentle, cloud-like voice.
"I want to become one with You!" I said.
When the divine experience slowly faded, it left me with a lasting inspiration to seek God. I realized, "He is eternal, ever-new Joy!" That memory stayed with me long after the vision ended.
"I am Light." The voice was soft, like clouds murmuring in the sky.
"I want to be one with You!"
As my deep feeling of divine joy slowly faded, I held on to a lasting inspiration- to seek God. "He is eternal, ever-new Joy!" This thought stayed with me long after that day of bliss.
Another memory from my early years stands out, and I even carry the proof of it to this day - a scar. One morning, my elder sister Uma and I were sitting under a neem tree in the yard of our home in Gorakhpur. She was helping me with a Bengali primer, though my attention kept wandering to the parrots nearby, nibbling on ripe margosa fruit.

---

Uma complained about a boil on her leg and went to get a jar of ointment. I took a little of the salve and rubbed it on my forearm.
"Why are you putting medicine on a healthy arm?" she asked.
"Well, Sis," I said, "I feel like I am going to have a boil tomorrow. I am just testing your ointment on the spot where it will show up."
"You little liar!" she said.
"Sis, don't call me a liar until you see what happens in the morning," I said, feeling annoyed.
Uma didn't believe me and called me a liar three more times. I spoke slowly and firmly, my voice filled with determination.
"By the power of my will, I say that tomorrow I will have a large boil right here on my arm. And your boil will grow to twice its size!"
The next morning, I woke up with a big boil exactly where I had said it would appear. Uma's boil had also doubled in size. With a loud scream, she ran to our mother. "Mukunda has become a sorcerer!" she cried.
Mother spoke to me seriously, warning me never to use the power of words to cause harm. I have always remembered her advice and followed it.
My boil had to be treated by a doctor, leaving a scar on my right forearm. That scar is a constant reminder of the power of words.
Those simple words I had spoken to Uma, though they seemed harmless, carried a hidden strength. Spoken with deep focus, they acted like tiny bombs, creating real, though harmful, results. Later, I came to understand that this powerful energy in speech can be used wisely to solve problems and make life better — without leaving scars or regrets.

Our family moved to Lahore, a city in Punjab. While living there, I got a picture of the Divine Mother in the form of the Goddess Kali. 42 I placed it in a small shrine on our home's balcony. I felt strongly that any prayer I said in that sacred spot would be answered
One day, I was standing there with my sister, Uma. We watched two kites flying over the roofs across the narrow lane.
"Why are you so quiet?" Uma asked, pushing me playfully.
"I am just thinking how amazing it is that the Divine Mother always gives me what I ask for," I replied.
"Do you think She would give you those two kites?" Uma laughed, clearly doubting me.
"Why not?" I said, and I began to silently pray for the kites.
In India, kite matches are popular. Players coat the kite strings with glue and powdered glass to cut the strings of their opponents' kites. When a kite's string is cut, it floats away, and people have fun trying to catch it. Since Uma and I were on the balcony, it seemed impossible for any of the kites to come to us. The strings would naturally fall over the rooftops.
The match started across the lane. Soon, one string was cut, and the kite began drifting in my direction. For a moment, it stopped moving because the wind slowed down. That brief pause allowed the string to get caught on a cactus plant on top of the opposite house. The string formed a perfect loop, making it easy for me to grab. I pulled the kite in and handed it to Uma.
"That was just a lucky accident, not an answer to your prayer," Uma said. "But if the other kite comes to you too, then I might believe you." Her eyes looked more surprised than her words sounded.
I prayed even harder this time. A sharp pull from the other player made his kite's string snap. The kite floated toward me, dancing in the wind. Once again, the cactus plant caught the string, creating another loop that I could grab. I pulled in the second kite and gave it to Uma.
"Divine Mother really listens to you! This is too strange for me!" Uma exclaimed, and then she ran off like a scared deer.
