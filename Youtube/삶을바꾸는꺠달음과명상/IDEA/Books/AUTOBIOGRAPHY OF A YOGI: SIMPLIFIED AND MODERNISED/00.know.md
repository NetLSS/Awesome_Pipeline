Author's Acknowledgments
I am very grateful to Miss L. V. Pratt for spending so much time editing the manuscript of this book. I also want to thank Miss Ruth Zahn for creating the index, Mr. C. Richard Wright for allowing me to use parts of his travel diary about India, and Dr. W. Y. Evans-Wentz for his helpful suggestions and support.
