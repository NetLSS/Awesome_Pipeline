The Role of Arunachala in His Teachings
To those who first encountered Ramana Maharshi, it was evident that his presence was deeply intertwined with the sacred mountain of Arunachala. Rising in quiet majesty from the plains of Tamil Nadu, Arunachala was no ordinary hill-it was an ancient symbol of the divine, revered for centuries as the very embodiment of Lord Shiva the supreme consciousness beyond name and form. For Ramana, however, Arunachala was not merely a sacred site of pilgrimage, nor just a place of serene natural beauty. It was the silent, all-encompassing reality itself, the unchanging presence that had drawn him to its slopes and never allowed him to leave.
From the moment he arrived as a sixteen-year-old boy, Arunachala became both his refuge and his teacher. He had no doubt that the mountain had called him. Even as a child, when he had first heard its name from a relative, he had felt an inexplicable pull toward it, a yearning he could not explain at the time. It was as though some deep unspoken connection existed between him and the mountain long before he had ever laid eyes upon it. When he finally arrived, having left behind his home and all worldly attachments, he surrendered completely, not only to the mountain but to the truth it represented.
In those early years, when he sat in silent absorption in the caves and temples scattered around Arunachala, his body forgotten, his mind dissolved in the stillness of pure being, the mountain seemed to cradle him in its unshakable presence. The echoes of ancient chants filled the air, mingling with the sounds of rustling leaves and distant temple bells, but none of it disturbed the vast silence that enveloped him. He needed no instruction, no scriptures, no guidance from outside. Arunachala itself was his guru, his guide, and his home.
Later, when seekers from across the world gathered around him, drawn by the radiance of his presence, Ramana often spoke of Arunachala not as a mere geographical location but as the very Self-the absolute reality beyond all illusion. Many came to him expecting complex discourses on philosophy, but instead, they found that he spoke of the mountain with the reverence one might reserve for the highest truth itself. To those who asked about the nature of liberation, he would simply say, "Arunachala is the Self. If one surrenders completely to it, liberation is assured."
For some, this was difficult to grasp. How could a mountain, an object of the natural world, be equated with the limitless, formless truth spoken of in Vedanta? But for Ramana, there was no distinction between the physical form of Arunachala and the formless awareness that it represented. To sit at its feet, to gaze upon its slopes, was to be reminded, again and again, of the stillness that lay at the core of one's own being.
It was no coincidence that Arunachala had been revered in Hindu tradition as a place of profound spiritual power. The Puranas described it as the site where Lord Shiva had manifested as an infinite column of light, beyond comprehension by either Brahma or Vishnu. The Arunachala Mahatmyam, a sacred text extolling its glory proclaimed that mere remembrance of the mountain was enough to bestow liberation. For Ramana, these were not mere legends; they were expressions of a truth he had directly realized.
When seekers asked him if pilgrimage to Arunachala was necessary for spiritual progress, he would sometimes smile and say, "Arunachala is always here. It is within you." He encouraged those who felt drawn to the mountain to come, to sit in its presence, to walk its sacred paths, but he also pointed beyond the external form. Arunachala was not merely the land upon which he had chosen to stay—it was the essence of what he taught. It was the silent teacher, ever available, ever waiting for those who were ready to listen.
Many devotees who stayed at Sri Ramanasramam found that their own minds grew quieter in the presence of the mountain. Even those who had struggled with restless thoughts and ceaseless questioning found, to their surprise, that something within them naturally stilled when they gazed upon its slopes. It was as though Arunachala itself absorbed all agitation, leaving behind only a vast, unshakable peace. Some came expecting to find an external master in Ramana, but instead, they discovered that the true teacher was the very land on which they sat.
Ramana himself often composed verses in praise of Arunachala, pouring into words the depth of his love for the mountain. His famous work, Arunachala Aksharamanamalai (The Marital Garland of Letters), was not merely devotional poetry; it was a song of absolute surrender, a declaration of the complete dissolving of the individua self into the infinite. In those verses, he called to Arunachala as one might call to a beloved, pleading for it to consume him, to devour his ego completely, leaving nothing but the pure awareness that it represented.
In time, more seekers began to understand what he meant. Arunachala was not separate from them. The mountain was their own heart, their own innermost being. To truly see Arunachala was to see oneself without illusion. To bow before it was to bow before the eternal presence that had always been Even as Ramana's fame spread, as visitors arrived from across the world, as books were written and disciples carried his teachings to distant lands, he remained at Arunachala. He never spoke of leaving, never considered seeking out another place. To him, there was no other place. "Where could I go?" he would say. "This is the center
This is the heart of the world."
And so he stayed, his life an unbroken offering to the silent presence that had claimed him as its own. Decades passed, the ashram grew, and generations of seekers came and went, but the mountain remained unchanged. It watched over all, as it had for centuries, as it would for centuries more.
Even after his physical passing, devotees continued to feel his presence at Arunachala. Many who came to the ashram after his mahasamadhi would say they still experienced his guidance, not as a voice, not as a vision, but as an unmistakable stillness that enveloped them as soon as they arrived. The mountain, which had drawn him as a boy, which had been his silent companion throughout his life, remained the unshaken witness of all.
For those who seek the essence of his teachings, Arunachala is not merely a place on a map. It is the ever-present reality, the eternal silence, the unmoving source from which all things arise and into which all things return. Whether seen with the eyes or felt within, it calls to those who are ready to listen—not with words, but with a silence deeper than all speech, a presence more real than any thought.
And for those who truly hear that call, there is nothing left to seek. The journey is already over. The mountain has already embraced them. They have already arrived.
