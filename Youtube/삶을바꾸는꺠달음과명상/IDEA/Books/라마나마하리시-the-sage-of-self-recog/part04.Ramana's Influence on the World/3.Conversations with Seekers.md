Conversations with Seekers
The hall where Ramana Maharshi sat was simple, unadorned, and unpretentious. There were no grand symbols, no elaborate seats of authority, no marks of distinction that separated him from those who came to see him. The room was quiet except for the occasional sound of birds outside or the rustling of leaves in the breeze that entered through the open doors. Seekers arrived from all walks of life-some in the robes of renunciates, others in the attire of householders, travelers, and scholars, and still others in the uniform of their professions, their minds burdened with questions.
Some came with doubts that had troubled them for years. Some arrived with eager enthusiasm, hoping to finally grasp the essence of truth. Others came simply to sit, feeling an inexplicable peace in his presence, as though the mere act of being near him was enough to dissolve their worries. For many, words were not needed at all. But for those who could not yet grasp the silent transmission of wisdom, who still sought understanding through the mind, Ramana offered words— few, precise, and piercing, like arrows that went straight to the heart of the questioner.
A man, weary from long years of wandering in search of truth, once sat before Ramana and asked, "I have studied the scriptures, I have practiced meditation, I have visited many holy places and met many great teachers. And yet, peace escapes me. What must I do to attain it?" Ramana, who had been gazing at him in silence, replied, "Peace is not something that can be attained. It is your very nature. The '!' that seeks is itself the disturbance. Find out who this 'l' is, and peace will reveal itself."
The man was stunned into silence. He had expected a method, a practice, a prescription of actions to follow. Instead, he was directed back to himself, to the one asking the question. He sat before Ramana for hours, his mind unable to move as it once had, as if the very structure of his thinking had been shaken at its foundation.
Another time, a young devotee, struggling with worly responsibilities, spoke of his troubles. "I wish to renounce everything and devote myself entirely to spiritual practice," he said. "But my family depends on me. I have duties that I cannot abandon, and so I feel trapped." Ramana's voice was soft but firm. "Who says you are bound? If you know yourself to be free, no work will bind you. The body may be engaged in action, but the Self remains untouched. Perform your duties, but know that you are not the doer."
For days after, the young man contemplated these words. Could it really be that liberation was not a matter of external renunciation but of inner understanding? Slowly, the struggle in his heart began to ease, as he realized that freedom was not found in abandoning the world but in no longer identifying with the one who felt burdened by it.
One day, a well-versed scholar from a distant land arrived, eager to debate the finer points of Advaita Vedanta. He had spent his life immersed in scriptural study and had come to test his understanding against that of the sage. "The scriptures declare that the Self is formless and beyond all attributes," he began. "But if the Self is beyond thought, how can it be known? And if it cannot be known, how can it be said to exist?"
Ramana listened patiently, then spoke with quiet certainty. "You say that the Self cannot be known. But tell me, do you exist?" The scholar hesitated. "Of course, I exist."
Ramana's eyes shone with a gentle clarity. "Then, who is it that knows this existence? That which knows the existence of the 'T' is the Self. It does not require another to know it. It is self-evident." The scholar sat back, his mind momentarily emptied of all argument. He had come prepared for an intellectual discussion, yet in a single sentence, Ramana had drawn him beyond intellect, beyond thought itself, into the direct recognition of being.
There were those who came to him in deep grief, struggling with loss and sorrow. A woman who had recently lost her husband wept before him, unable to find solace in the teachings she had followed for so long. "He was everything to me," she said. "Now he is gone, and I am lost." Ramana's gaze was filled with compassion. "Who is lost?" he asked. "You say that he is gone. But tell me, where did he go? Did he ever exist apart from your awareness of him? And this awareness— has it diminished in any way?" She sat silently, unable to respond. Slowly, as the weight of grief lifted just a little, she began to realize that love, presence, and being were not things that could be lost. The body may disappear, but the awareness in which love had always existed remained unchanged.
Some visitors sought miracles, hoping that Ramana's gaze alone could heal their suffering. Others came with skepticism, unsure if he was truly enlightened or merely another teacher in a long tradition of gurus. Regardless of their expectations, they all encountered the same stillness. Some left transformed, others bewildered, but none left untouched.
There were moments of laughter, too. Ramana, despite his serene detachment, was not without humor. A devotee once asked, "Bhagavan, I try to meditate, but my mind constantly wanders. What should I do?" Ramana smiled and replied, "Where does it wander?"
The devotee hesitated, unsure of how to answer. "Everywhere," he admitted.
Ramana laughed gently. "If it wanders everywhere, then it must be everywhere. Find out where it rises from, and it will no longer need to wander."
Time passed in his presence like water flowing over smooth stones - effortless, without resistance. The conversations he had were never meant to provide more knowledge to the seeker; they were meant to strip away the illusion of seeking itself. Words, however profound, were only pointers. Again and again, he brought those who came to him back to the one essential question: Who am I?
Those who listened deeply, who allowed the question to take root in their hearts, found that it was not merely a question —it was a doorway, leading beyond thought, beyond identity, beyond the restless movements of the mind. And as they sat before him, whether in spoken dialogue or in silent communion, something within them
recognized the truth of his words.
The hall remained the same. The mountain stood unchanged. The questions of seekers came and went, but the answers never wavered. They did not change because they did not need to. No matter the form of the inquiry-whether it arose from grief, confusion, longing, or intellectual curiosity— the response was always the same: Turn within. Find the source. Abide in that which has always been.
And for those who truly listened, the need for further questions simply faded away.
