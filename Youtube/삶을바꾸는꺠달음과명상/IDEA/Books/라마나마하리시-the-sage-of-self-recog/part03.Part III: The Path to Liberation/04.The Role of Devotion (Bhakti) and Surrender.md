The Role of Devotion (Bhakti) and Surrender
For many seekers, the path to truth was a struggle of the intellect, an effort to penetrate the mysteries of existence through inquiry and reflection. They came to Ramana Maharshi with questions, eager to dissect reality, to grasp the nature of the self through the sharpness of their minds. Yet, there were others for whom the way was entirely different— those who sought not to analyze but to offer themselves completely, those who approached the highest truth not through thought, but through love. For these, the path was not one of investigation, but of surrender.
Ramana, though often associated with the rigorous inquiry of Who am I?, never dismissed devotion as a lesser path. He knew that the longing for the divine, the deep and unwavering love that drew one toward something greater than oneself, was no different from the pursuit of self-knowledge. Bhakti, the path of devotion, was simply another way of dissolving the ego, another means of returning to the truth that had always been. Whether one asked, Who am I? or whether one bowed in love before the divine, the destination was the same— the loss of the false self and the recognition of the infinite.
For some, surrender was the only way. Their hearts were filled not with questions, but with an aching love, a longing that could not be explained. They did not seek understanding through the mind, nor did they struggle to peel away the illusions of thought. Instead, they simply offered themselves - entirely, without reservation- to that which they knew to be beyond them. They did not need to name it; they did not need to define it. Whether they called it God, the Self, the Guru, or the nameless presence that pervaded all things, it made no difference. The essence of surrender was not in the name, but in the act of letting go, in the willingness to dissolve completely into that which was greater than oneself.
In the presence of Ramana, surrender often happened effortlessly. Many who came to him seeking answers found, instead, that their questions fell away. There was something in him — a vast stillness, a silent knowing- that made one feel that there was no longer anything to ask. The mind, so accustomed to grasping, to holding, to analyzing, simply stopped. What remained was a quiet devotion, a love that had no need for explanation. Some found themselves bowing before him, not out of obligation, not because they saw him as a person, but because something within them recognized itself in his presence.
Ramana himself never demanded devotion. He never asked to be worshipped, never presented himself as a master to be obeyed. He was simply there, a mirror reflecting back to each seeker the truth of their own being. And yet, for many, love for him arose naturally, without effort, without thought. In his presence, they felt a deep and unshakable peace, and from that peace, devotion was born.
Some wept at his feet, overwhelmed by a love they could not contain. Others sat in silent reverence, drawn into a stillness that dissolved all sense of separation. There were those who saw him as a manifestation of the divine, a living embodiment of the formless presence they had long sought. And there were those who, unable to express their devotion in words, simply served - cooking food, sweeping the ashram grounds, caring for the animals that lived in his midst. Whether through prayer, through silent adoration, or through the smallest acts of service, their devotion was the same: a surrendering of themselves, an offering of their very being.
Yet, even for these lovers of the divine, Ramana's teaching remained the same. He did not encourage them to see him as separate from themselves. He did not place himself above them, nor did he accept their devotion as something given to a person. Instead, he gently guided them to see that the love they felt for him, the surrender they offered, was not truly to him as an individual, but to the Self-the infinite, unchanging presence that was within them as much as it was within him.
For those who loved God, he asked, Where is this God that you love? Is He outside you, separate from you? Or is He within, closer than your own breath, your own heartbeat? And if He was within, then who was the one who loved Him? Who was the one who surrendered? The lover and the beloved, the seeker and the sought — were they ever truly two? Or was it only the mind that imagined a distance, a separation that had never been real?
In this way, Ramana showed that devotion was not something different from self-inquiry. To love the divine was to long for union with it. To surrender to it was to give up the false idea of oneself. And in that surrender, the individual, the limited sense of "I," vanished. What remained was only the One, the eternal presence that had never been separate to begin with.
For those who struggled with self-inquiry, who found the mind too restless to turn inward, surrender was often the gentler path. It required no intellectual effort, no breaking down of thoughts. It was simply the willingness to give oneself over, to trust completely in that which was beyond comprehension. And yet, the result was the same: the ego dissolved, the false self fell away, and what remained was only the vast, boundless reality of the Self.
Ramana himself embodied both paths, effortlessly merging devotion and knowledge into a single, seamless whole. Though he rarely spoke of personal devotion, his every action was an act of surrender. He had given himself completely to the will of the divine, to the natural unfolding of life, without resistance, without any sense of personal identity. Whether he sat in silence or answered a question, whether he tended to the animals that lived in the ashram or allowed his body to waste away in illness without complaint, everything he did was the expression of a being who had already disappeared into the infinite.
For those who came to him, seeking either knowledge or love, he was both Guru and God, both guide and goal. And yet, his only message, repeated again and again in different ways, was always the same: that what they sought was already within them. Whether through inquiry or through devotion, whether by asking Who am I? or by surrendering completely to the divine, the destination was the same the recognition that there had never been a seeker at all, only the eternal, infinite Self.
Thus, for the devotee, for the lover of God, for the one who longed to give everything and hold nothing back, the path was clear. There was nothing to be done but to let go completely, to trust, to offer everything-mind, body, self - to that which was beyond all name and form. In that surrender, all struggles ended, all seeking ceased. And what remained was only the silent, unshakable peace of pure being, the love that had always been, the truth that had never been apart from oneself.
