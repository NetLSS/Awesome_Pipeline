The Nature of Consciousness
To sit in the presence of Ramana Maharshi was to sit before the stillness of pure awareness itself. His gaze, serene and unwavering, carried no trace of personal identity, no sense of separation between himself and those who sat before him. He spoke little, yet his very presence radiated an unmistakable truth - one that required no words to convey. Those who came to him seeking understanding were not given elaborate teachings on metaphysics or grand explanations of existence. Instead, they were gently led to the only thing that truly mattered: the direct experience of consciousness itself.
Consciousness, he would say, is not something one attains. It is not something that comes and goes, nor is it something separate from oneself. It is the very essence of being, the silent witness that is ever-present, whether the mind is active or still, whether the body is awake or asleep. It is not an object to be known but the very knower itself, the light by which all things are perceived, yet which itself remains untouched by what it illuminates.
The human experience is a ceaseless movement of thoughts, emotions, and sensations, all appearing within awareness, yet never altering it. The mind rushes forward, seeking experiences, attaching itself to names and forms, believing itself to be the center of existence. And yet, if one were to step back and observe, a profound truth would reveal itself: everything that is perceived - every thought, every feeling, every moment of pleasure or pain —arises and fades, yet something remains unchanged. That which knows the movement of the mind is itself unmoving. That which perceives time is itself beyond time. That which witnesses change is itself changeless.
Ramana invited seekers to turn their attention away from the fleeting and toward the eternal. The mind, he explained, can never grasp consciousness, for it is merely an appearance within it. Like the moon borrowing its light from the sun, the mind only functions because of the presence of consciousness. Yet, the mind constantly claims ownership over experience, mistaking itself for the source of awareness, much like a shadow believing itself to be the object that casts it.
For those who earnestly questioned the nature of consciousness, an inevitable realization arose: all that had ever been known, all that had ever been experienced, had existed only within the field of awareness. The world, the body, the very sense of "I"-all of it appeared and disappeared within the same unchanging presence. If the body was consciousness, how could it vanish in sleep? If the mind was consciousness, how could it be absent in deep, dreamless rest? And yet, even in those moments when thoughts and perceptions dissolved, there remained something that had not ceased —pure being, unconditioned and infinite In his quiet and effortless way, Ramana guided seekers to this recognition, not through argument or persuasion, but through the sheer force of his own unshaken awareness. He was not imparting knowledge, nor was he offering a belief system. He was simply pointing to what had always been — the reality that had never been absent, yet which had gone unnoticed beneath the veil of mental activity. To those who truly listened, there was nothing left to seek.
Consciousness, he made clear, is not something personal. It is not "mine" or "yours." It does not belong to an individual, nor does it arise with the birth of the body. It is not contained within space, nor bound by time. It is not something that can be possessed, for it is the very substance of all existence. The idea that there is a separate ""' experiencing a separate world is nothing more than a projection of the mind—a mirage that vanishes the moment one turns inward and sees with clear eyes.
Yet, for most, this truth was difficult to grasp. The mind, conditioned to identify with form, resisted the idea that it was itself an illusion. It clung to its sense of individuality, insisting that awareness must belong to the person, that it must have a beginning and an end. But Ramana asked a simple question: could consciousness ever be absent? Could there ever be a moment in which one was not aware of being? Even in sleep, in the absence of thoughts, there remained a presence, a knowingness that could not be denied. And if consciousness was ever-present, how could it be something that was created or destroyed? How could it be bound by the body when it had no boundaries of its own?
For those who went deeply into these questions, the separate self dissolved like mist in the morning sun. The distinction between inner and outer, subject and object, self and other, faded into the recognition that there had never been two to begin with —only the one, limitless awareness in which all things appeared and disappeared.
This, Ramana taught, was liberation -not an attainment, not an experience to be gained, but the recognition of what had always been. To know oneself as consciousness was to be free from all bondage, for bondage itself was nothing but the belief in a separate self. With this realization, suffering lost its grip, desires fell away, and fear had no more ground to stand on. What remained was only silence, vast and unshaken, the infinite stillness of pure being.
And so, in his presence, those who were ready found themselves drawn into that silence, not as something outside themselves, but as the truth of their own existence. The mind could ask no more questions, for there was no longer anything to seek. The search had ended in the only place it ever could — in the eternal, boundless awareness that had been there all along.
