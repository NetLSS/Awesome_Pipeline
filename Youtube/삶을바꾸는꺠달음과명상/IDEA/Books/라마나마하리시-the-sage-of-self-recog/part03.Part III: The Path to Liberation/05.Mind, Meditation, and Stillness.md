Mind, Meditation, and Stillness
The mind is like a restless wind, ceaselessly moving, never content to be still. It leaps from one thought to another, weaving together an intricate web of desires, fears, memories, and expectations. It carries one forward into imagined futures and backward into remembered pasts, rarely allowing a moment of true presence. In its movement, it creates the illusion of separation-the sense of an individual self, distinct from the world, distinct from others, distinct even from the vast and silent awareness that underlies all experience.
For those who sought Ramana Maharshi, the greatest challenge was often this unceasing activity of the mind. How could one find the Self, the pure consciousness that he spoke of, when thoughts never seemed to stop? How could one turn inward when the mind constantly turned outward, drawn by the attractions and distractions of the world? Was there a way to quiet the storm, to bring the restless waves to calm?
Ramana's response was both simple and profound. The mind, he would say, need not be battled or suppressed. It need only be traced to its source. Instead of chasing thoughts, one must ask, To whom do these thoughts arise? Who is the one that perceives them? The moment the mind turns back upon itself, seeking the root of its existence, a strange thing happens: it begins to dissolve. The very act of inquiry reveals that the mind itself is nothing but a fleeting appearance, a movement within the vast, unchanging stillness of awareness.
And yet, for many seekers, this direct path of self-inquiry was difficult. The mind, so accustomed to movement, resisted stillness. It refused to let go. And so, Ramana spoke often of meditation—not as an effortful practice, not as a struggle to control thought, but as the natural resting of the mind in its true state. Meditation was not an action, not something one did, but a return to what had always been. It was not about creating stillness but recognizing that stillness had never been absent.
For most, meditation was thought of as a practice, something one engaged in for a time before returning to the activities of daily life. But for Ramana, meditation was not separate from life itself. True meditation was not merely sitting in silence with closed eyes; it was abiding effortlessly in the awareness that underlies all things. It was not about retreating from the world, nor was it about forcing the mind into quietude. Instead, it was about recognizing that beyond the surface-level activity of thought, there was always a deeper stillness, a silent presence that had never been disturbed.
Stillness was the essence of the Self, and the mind, when turned inward, naturally dissolved into it. To be truly meditative was not to practice a technique, not to repeat a mantra, not to control the breath or force the mind to be empty. It was simply to abide as one truly was, without effort, without struggle. The mind, left to itself, would always seek movement, but the Self— the pure awareness that one truly was—had never moved. To recognize this, to rest in it fully, was the highest form of meditation.
And yet, seekers struggled. The mind, conditioned by habit, returned again and again to its old patterns. Thoughts arose, distracting and persistent, carrying one away before awareness could catch them. For these seekers, Ramana offered reassurance: Do not fight the mind. Do not engage in battle with thoughts. Simply watch. Let them come and go. And above all, ask: To whom do these thoughts arise?
This simple question cut through the endless stream of mental activity, returning attention again and again to its source. The mind, when traced back to its origin, could no longer sustain its illusions. It could no longer pretend to exist apart from the awareness in which it arose. And in that recognition, thoughts lost their power, like clouds dissolving into the vastness of the sky.
Stillness was not something to be achieved. It was not something distant, waiting to be attained. It was already present, always had been. It was the natural state, the very foundation of all experience. The mind, with all its restlessness, with all its grasping, was nothing but a temporary disturbance upon the surface of this infinite stillness. Like ripples upon a still pond, thoughts appeared, moved for a time, and then faded.
But the pond itself had never been disturbed.
To abide in this truth, to rest in the silent awareness that underlay all things, was the essence of meditation. It was not about effort, not about struggle. It was simply about returning, again and again, to what had never been lost. The stillness that one sought was already here. It had always been here. And once recognized, it could never be forgotten.
