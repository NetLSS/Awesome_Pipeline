The Years of Intense Meditation
When Ramana Maharshi arrived at Arunachala, the sacred mountain that had drawn him with an irresistible force, he did not come seeking anything. There was no goal, no ambition, no need for further inquiry. The truth had already revealed itself to him in its fullest, stripping away every illusion of self, of past, of future. He did not consider himself a pilgrim, nor did he see himself as a seeker. He had simply returned-to a place that felt as though it had been waiting for him since before time began.
The mountain itself was no ordinary landscape. Rising from the plains of Tamil Nadu like an ancient sentinel, Arunachala had long been revered as a living embodiment of the divine. Its rocky slopes, its quiet groves, and its hidden caves had, for centuries, provided refuge to sages, ascetics, and wandering saints. But for Ramana, Arunachala was not just a place of retreat-it was home. From the moment he arrived, he merged with its silence, as if the very stones of the mountain had absorbed him into their timeless stillness.
The first years of his life there were marked by an intensity that few could comprehend. He withdrew completely from the world, losing himself in the depths of meditation so completely that the boundaries between himself and the mountain, between mind and space, between existence and non-existence, seemed to vanish. He did not speak, nor did he seek food or shelter. He remained in a state of effortless absorption, motionless for hours, then days, then weeks. Time itself seemed to lose its meaning, dissolving into the vast expanse of awareness in which he was submerged.
For long periods, he stayed in the Patala Lingam, an underground chamber in the temple of Arunachaleswarar. It was a dark, damp space, untouched by sunlight, where scorpions and insects moved undisturbed. But none of this concerned him. He had ceased to identify with the body; whether it was cold, hot, bitten, or bruised was of no importance. Deep in meditation, he was unaware of anything beyond the silent presence that had claimed him.
Days passed, then weeks, and he remained in the same posture, utterly still, his body wasting away from lack of food and care. His limbs became thin, his skin pale, yet there was no movement, no request for nourishment, no acknowledgment of the outer world at all. Left to himself, he might have remained there indefinitely, absorbed in the absolute, unaware that his physical form was slowly deteriorating.
It was only through the intervention of kindhearted devotees that he was brought back into some form of worldly existence. Recognizing in him something extraordinary, they carried his frail body out of the underground chamber, cleaned his wounds— inflicted by insects and rats while he sat immobile and offered him simple food.
Yet even then, he remained silent, unmoving, his gaze turned inward toward a dimension beyond form, beyond speech.
As time passed, he moved from one solitary place to another — silent temple halls, abandoned shrines, and, finally, the caves that dotted the slopes of Arunachala. These caves, hidden from the bustling life of the town below, became his refuge. There, away from the distractions of the world, he could rest undisturbed in the stillness that had overtaken him. Virupaksha Cave and later Skandashram became the sites of his prolonged meditations, places where he remained in a state of unfathomable absorption.
To the casual observer, it might have seemed as though he was lost in a trance, disconnected from the world. But in truth, there was nothing passive about his state. The silence in which he sat was not emptiness it was the fullness of being itself, vast and all-encompassing. It was not an escape from life, but a direct merging with the
very essence of existence. There was no need for words, no need for explanations. Reality, as it was, had revealed itself completely, leaving no room for doubt, for striving, for anything at all except pure, luminous presence.
Over the years, word of the silent sage on Arunachala spread. At first, only a few curious seekers made the arduous journey up the mountain to find him. They came hesitantly, unsure of what to expect, carrying their questions and doubts. But when they arrived, they found that something remarkable happened in his presence. Often, without a word spoken, without any verbal exchange, their minds would fall silent. Their restless thoughts would slow, their anxieties dissolve, and they would find themselves slipping into the same vast stillness that surrounded him.
The power of his meditation, the sheer intensity of his presence, created an atmosphere unlike any other. Those who came with complicated spiritual inquiries found that their questions simply vanished before they could even be spoken. In that silence, there was no need for answers— for the very nature of their seeking itself dissolved What remained was only peace, a peace that could not be understood intellectually but could be felt, deep and unshakable, within the very core of one's being.
Despite his growing renown, Ramana himself remained unchanged. He did not consider himself a teacher, nor did he assume the role of a guru. He did not offer discourses, nor did he seek followers. He simply continued as he always had - sitting in silence, lost in the boundless expanse of the Self. If people came to him, he did not turn them away. If they spoke, he sometimes responded with the fewest words possible. But beyond any verbal teachings, it was his presence, his state of being, that spoke most powerfully.
There were no rituals, no ceremonies, no elaborate instructions. Only the unbroken flow of silence, the steady radiance of stillness that needed no interpretation. His meditation was not a practice- it was his very nature. And those who sat with him, even for a short time, found themselves drawn into the same infinite awareness, the same effortless peace that he lived in every moment.
Years passed in this way, and yet, time itself seemed irrelevant. To the world, these were the years of intense meditation, of deep austerity, But for Ramana, there was no austerity, no effort, no struggle. There was only the simple, natural abiding in what he had already seen to be true. And in that abiding, the boundaries of self and other
of time and space, dissolved completely.
As the days unfolded like ripples on a vast and endless ocean, Ramana remained where he had always been not in any particular cave, not on any particular mountain, but in the boundless, ever-present reality that he had realized as his own true nature. And for those who came to him, seeking guidance, seeking wisdom, seeking peace
his very being spoke louder than any words ever could, whispering in the silent language of the eternal:
"Be still, and know that you are That."
