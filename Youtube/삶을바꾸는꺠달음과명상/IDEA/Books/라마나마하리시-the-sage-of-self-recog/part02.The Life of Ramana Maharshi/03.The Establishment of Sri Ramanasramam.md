The Establishment of Sri Ramanasramam
The mountain had always been his home. From the moment he arrived in Tiruvannamalai as a boy of sixteen, Ramana Maharshi had lived in its caves, under its trees, and within the embrace of its silent slopes. For years, he had remained untouched by the world, indifferent to the passage of time, absorbed in the vast and unshakable awareness that had claimed him. He had neither sought nor refused the company of others, accepting all who came with the same quiet equanimity. But as the years passed, the growing stream of seekers drawn to his presence made it inevitable that a more stable dwelling would have to arise.
It did not happen all at once. There was no grand plan, no deliberate effort to build an ashram. The process unfolded as naturally as a tree growing toward the sun, its roots deepening, its branches spreading, responding to the needs of those who found shelter beneath it. What began as a single hut near the base of Arunachala gradually became something more, shaped not by human ambition but by the quiet pull of devotion, by the simple necessity of accommodating the many souls who could not bear to leave the sage's presence.
For many years, Ramana had lived in Skandashram, a cave on the eastern slopes of Arunachala, where he had spent long hours in deep silence. The cave, nestled amidst rocks and sparse vegetation, had been his sanctuary, a place where the endless procession of time seemed to dissolve into the eternal stillness of the Self. Here, seekers gathered, sitting in his silent company, often finding that their restless minds stilled without effort, as if caught in the gravitational field of something vast and immeasurable.
But change was inevitable. In 1922, when Ramana's mother, Alagammal, who had come to live with him in her later years, passed away, her body was interred at the base of the mountain. This event marked a quiet turning point. Devotees, wishing to remain close to both the master and the place where his mother rested, began to settle around the site. A small thatched hut was built near her tomb, followed by another, and then another. What had once been a lonely resting place for a mother became the nucleus of what would soon be known as Sri Ramanasramam.
At first, Ramana himself made no particular claim over the place. He simply moved where circumstances led him, as effortlessly as a leaf carried by the wind. He did not see the ashram as something separate from the mountain, nor did he feel any sense of ownership over it. It was a place that had arisen naturally, a confluence of devotion and necessity, and he accepted it as he accepted everything-without resistance, without attachment.
Yet, as more seekers came, drawn by the indescribable peace that radiated from him, the ashram began to take on a life of its own. The simple huts gave way to more solid structures. A hall was built where people could gather in his presence, sitting in silent meditation or listening to the rare, softly spoken words that he offered in response to their questions. A kitchen was added, where meals were prepared and served to all who arrived, regardless of caste, wealth, or status. The ashram became not just a dwelling for Ramana but a refuge for all who sought the stillness he embodied.
Despite the growth of the ashram, life remained simple. Ramana himself took no special position within it. He lived as he always had unconcerned with possessions, without any sense of authority, moving with the same unassuming grace whether he was sitting in deep meditation or peeling vegetables in the kitchen. He did not dictate how the ashram should be run, nor did he seek to organize or control it. If decisions needed to be made, they were made by those around him. He was simply present, a silent, unshakable presence at the heart of it all.
Though Sri Ramanasramam had grown into a place where many gathered, it never became an institution in the conventional sense. There were no elaborate rituals, no prescribed spiritual practices, no rigid structures. Ramana did not establish a formal school of thought, nor did he declare disciples or successors. The teaching remained what it had always been—pure, direct, free of ornamentation. Those who came were not expected to adopt a particular philosophy, but rather to turn inward, to discover for themselves the truth that was already present within them.
The days in the ashram followed a quiet rhythm. Mornings were filled with the sound of birds and the soft murmurs of devotees preparing the day's meals. Some engaged in the simple tasks of daily life- cooking, sweeping, tending to the cows that had become part of the ashram's family. Others sat in silent meditation, drawn into the deep, unbroken stillness that permeated the place. In the afternoons, visitors would come-some seeking answers, others simply seeking the peace of his presence. Sometimes, Ramana would speak, his words always few but always enough. More often, he would remain silent, his gaze itself conveying what no words could express.
The ashram became a place where all distinctions faded. Scholars and illiterates, rich and poor, householders and renunciates- all sat side by side, bound by the invisible thread of something deeper than any worldly identity. People from distant lands began to arrive, having heard of the silent sage who spoke of a truth that required no intermediary, no elaborate philosophy. They came expecting teachings, only to find that the greatest teaching was the stillness itself, the silent invitation to turn inward and recognize that which had always been.
Yet, for all its growth, the ashram remained an extension of the same simplicity that had defined Ramana's life from the beginning. It was not a place of grandeur or formalities. It was, at its heart, a place of silence a living testament to the truth that he had realized as a young boy lying on the floor in his uncle's house, the truth that had led him to Arunachala, the truth that he had never departed from.
In time, Sri Ramanasramam would become a sacred pilgrimage site, visited by thousands, its halls filled with the echoes of those who had come seeking peace. But for Ramana himself, nothing had ever changed. Whether he sat alone in a cave or among the many who now sought his presence, he remained as he had always been —utterly still, utterly free, the unmoving center around which all else revolved.
