Ramana as Guru and Friend
To those who came seeking a guru, Ramana Maharshi was unlike any they had ever encountered. He did not claim disciples, nor did he initiate anyone with mantras or ceremonies. He did not declare himself a teacher, nor did he demand obedience or devotion. Yet, in his presence, something profound happened. The very air aroun him seemed charged with an indescribable peace, a silence that spoke louder than words. Those who sat with him often found their questions dissolving before they could even be voiced. It was as if, in the light of his being, the restless mind had no choice but to become still, to surrender itself into the vast, unwavering presence that he embodied.
His role as a guru was not one of deliberate instruction but of pure being. He did not shape his devotees through lectures or elaborate spiritual guidance. Instead, he drew them inward, toward the core of their own existence, simply by the force of his silence. There was nothing theoretical about his teaching. He did not expound doctrines or engage in philosophical arguments. His guidance was simple yet absolute turn inward, ask "Who am I?" and rest in that awareness. There was no need for long explanations because the truth was not something to be grasped intellectually but something to be directly realized.
To sit before him was to be invited into an experience rather than a concept. Devotees spoke of moments when, without any external effort, they would feel their minds slowing, their usual anxieties fading into an ocean of stillness. For some, it was an unsettling experience at first — the ego resisted, grasping for its usual distractions, its habitual sense of self. But for those who surrendered, even for a moment, there was a taste of something beyond the mind, something vast and boundless.
Yet, for all the depth of his wisdom, Ramana never placed himself above those who came to him. He was not a distant figure of authority, removed from the ordinary affairs of life. To many, he was not just a guru but a friend, someone whose presence felt as natural as the mountain on which he lived. He did not demand reverence, no did he surround himself with ceremony. He moved through the daily routines of the ashram without any sense of superiority, peeling vegetables in the kitchen, tending to the cows, or walking barefoot among those who had come to see him. If someone bowed before him, he did not insist on it. If someone spoke to him informally, he
responded in Kina.
For those who sought personal attention, he was patient, listening with the same quiet presence whether the seeker was a scholar asking intricate questions or a simple villager speaking of daily troubles. He did not give preferential treatment based on status or learning. If someone asked a question, he answered —not to display knowledge but to guide them toward the direct experience of truth. And often, his response was not an answer at all but a return to the essential inquiry: Who is asking? Who is the "I" that seeks?
There were moments when a single look from him was enough to shake a person to their core. His gaze, steady and unwavering, seemed to pierce through the layers of identity, revealing to the seeker something they had long forgotten - their own unchanging Self. There were no theatrics in his presence, no displays of mystical power And yet, countless devotees spoke of the transformation they experienced simply by being near him, as if his very presence ignited within them the awareness they had been searching for all their lives.
Though he lived in an ashram surrounded by devotees, Ramana had no need for control. He did not impose rules or restrictions on those who followed him. If people wished to chant, they could chant. If they wished to sit in silence, they could sit in silence. If they followed other practices, he did not interfere. His only concern was whether they recognized the truth within themselves. He never claimed authority over another's spiritual path. He merely pointed the way, and those who were ready followed the call within their own hearts.
At times, devotees tried to elevate him into something grander than he would allow. They composed hymns in his praise, which he often dismissed with a smile. Some sought to attribute miracles to him, but he showed no interest in such things. If someone was healed in his presence, he took no credit. If an extraordinary event occurred he remained unaffected. He had no desire to be seen as special, for in his view, there was no separate self to be glorified. All that existed was the Self, and that Self was not his alone— it belonged to all, for it was the very essence of being itself.
Despite his immense compassion, he did not indulge in personal attachments. If a devotee wept before him, he did not offer comforting words. Not because he lacked kindness, but because he saw beyond the personal suffering to the deeper truth that lay beneath it. He did not encourage dependency; instead, he gently guided people to stand on their own, to look within for the source of peace rather than outside. His love was vast, but it was not the love of attachment —it was the love of truth, the love that sought only to dissolve the illusions that bound people to suffering.
His humor, too, was ever-present. He did not take himself seriously, nor did he allow others to place undue weight on anything transient. If someone recounted a vision or a mystical experience in his presence, he often shrugged it off. What was the use of visions, he would say, if one did not know who was seeing them? If a devotee spoke of spiritual struggles, he might respond with a smile and a question so simple yet so profound that the very foundation of their worries would crumble.
To those who followed him, he was both the vastness of an enlightened master and the simplicity of an ordinary man. He was the silence of the mountain and the warmth of a friend. He was the sage who sat in deep meditation, unmoved by the world, and the companion who shared in the small joys of daily life, whether feeding squirrels or watching children play. He belonged to no tradition, no sect, no hierarchy. He was simply as he was— untouched, unclaimed, free.
And in that freedom, he offered the greatest gift of all. He did not seek followers. He did not seek worship. He sought only for each person who came to him to realize that they too were already free, that the truth he had realized was not his alone but the birthright of all. He pointed not to himself but to the Self, not to any external path but to the silence within. And for those who truly understood, no further guidance was needed. The guru had done his work —not by leading them anywhere, but by showing them that they had never left home in the first place.
