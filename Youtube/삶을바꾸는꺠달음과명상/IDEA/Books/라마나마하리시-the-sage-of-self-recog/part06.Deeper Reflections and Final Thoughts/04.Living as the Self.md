Living as the Self
To realize the Self is one thing, but to live as the Self is something far deeper, more subtle, and yet as natural as breathing. The realization of truth, once glimpsed, is not meant to remain as an abstract understanding or a fleeting experience. It is meant to permeate every thought, every action, and every moment of life, dissolving the illusion of separation, freeing one from the entanglements of the mind, and allowing existence to flow in its most natural and effortless way.
For those who came to Ramana Maharshi, the question was not only how to recognize the truth but how to remain established in it. Many seekers, after experiencing a moment of clarity, found themselves once again caught in the currents of the world, in the endless movements of thought, desire, and habit. The illusion of the personal self, though seen as false, had a way of reasserting itself, as if it had never been questioned at all. Was it possible to move through life, engaging with the world, fulfilling responsibilities, meeting the needs of the body, while remaining rooted in the unshakable stillness of the Self?
Ramana's presence itself was the answer to this question. He did not withdraw from the world, nor did he reject the body, speech, or action. He ate when food was placed before him, spoke when words were needed, laughed when joy arose, and remained silent when there was nothing to be said. Yet, in all of this, there was no T'behind the action, no personal claim to experience, no sense of a separate entity moving through life. Everything unfolded as it was meant to, like the wind moving through the trees, like the river flowing to the ocean, effortless, natural, and free.
To live as the Self does not mean to retreat from the world, nor does it require the renunciation of all activity. It means simply to abide as one truly is, to no longer be caught in the illusion of an individual doer. The body may act, the mind may think, words may arise and disappear, but the underlying awareness remains untouched, vast and still, unmoved by the play of form. It is like the sky in which clouds appear and disappear, the ocean upon which waves rise and fall-always present, always whole, never diminished, never disturbed.
This living freedom is not something to be practiced in the sense of a technique or a method. It is the direct and immediate recognition that there is no personal T' to uphold, no separate entity to defend, no identity to maintain. What remains is the silent presence that has always been, the pure being that needs no effort to sustain itself When this is seen, life continues, but the burden of individuality falls away. The endless striving, the need to control, the anxiety of becoming â€”all of it dissolves in the realization that there was never anyone to protect, never anything to achieve, never a journey to undertake.
For the one who lives as the Self, life unfolds in its own rhythm, neither resisted nor grasped. There is no longer fear, for there is no longer anyone to be threatened. There is no longer attachment, for there is no longer anyone to possess or be possessed. There is no longer a need to seek, for there is no longer a sense of lack. In the absence of the false self, what remains is perfect wholeness, the boundless presence that was never born and will never die.
This is the true meaning of liberation -not an escape from the world, not the attainment of some distant state, but the simple and effortless recognition that there is only the Self, only this eternal presence, shining in all things. To live as the Self is not to become something new, but to cease pretending to be something one is not. It is to let go of the false and rest in the truth, to let the waves of life rise and fall without claiming ownership, to move through the world as the open sky, untouched, infinite, free.
Ramana did not ask his followers to change their outer lives, nor did he demand that they renounce the world. He only asked them to see clearly, to recognize the illusion of the separate self, and to abide in that recognition. Whether in solitude or in society, whether engaged in work or sitting in silence, the truth remained the same. There was nothing to add, nothing to remove, only the clear seeing that what one truly is had never been bound, had never been lost, had never been other than this limitless awareness, this silent and eternal presence.
In the end, there is no practice for this, no process to be followed. It is the simplest thing, the most immediate truth - so close that it is overlooked, so present that it is ignored. And yet, once seen, it is undeniable. To live as the Self is not to change anything about life but to see that life was never separate from truth. It is to recognize, beyond all doubt, that there is only this, only now, only the pure, unbroken awareness in which all things arise and dissolve, without effort, without struggle, without end.
