CHAPTER 2: THE USELESS TREE
The Parable
A carpenter and his apprentice once walked past a massive, ancient tree with twisted branches and a gnarled trunk. The apprentice pointed at the tree and remarked, "What a useless tree! Its wood is too knotted for building, and its branches are too bent for making furniture." Hearing this, the old carpenter smiled and said, "Precisely because it is useless, it has survived for so long. If it were straight and strong, it would have been chopped down long ago." Zhuangzi presents this story to challenge our conventional notions of value and purpose, illustrating that what appears useless may, in fact, be the key to true freedom and longevity.

But if it were alive, would it not rather be free, dragging its tail in the mud?"
Through these stories, Zhuangzi suggests that conventional success often comes at a cost. Sometimes, what is deemed "useless" is actually the source of true contentment and longevity.
Historical & Philosophical Context
During the Warring States period, society placed great value on practical utility. Strong warriors were recruited for battle, wise scholars were selected as advisors, and those with talent were expected to contribute to the state. Yet, Zhuangzi's parables question this very mindset, proposing that those who escape the demands of
society (by appearing useless) might actually lead happier, freer lives.
Daoism contrasts sharply with Confucianism in this regard. Confucian thought emphasizes duty, hierarchy, and social responsibility, whereas Zhuangzi advocates for spontaneity, individual freedom, and detachment from rigid roles. The idea that being "useless" can be beneficial is a radical rejection of Confucian ideals and an embrace of Wu Wei (effortless action)-living in harmony with the natural flow of life.
Commentary & Insights
We often judge things- and people- based on their perceived usefulness. From an early age, we are taught to maximize our potential, pursue careers that contribute to society, and avoid wasting time on things that don't provide tangible rewards.
But what if stepping outside this mindset is the key to happiness?
The useless tree survives because it does not conform to conventional expectations. In modern terms, this could mean choosing an unconventional career, pursuing hobbies that seem unproductive, or living a lifestyle that prioritizes peace over ambition.
By embracing the idea that not everything needs to serve a purpose, we free ourselves from constant striving and allow life to unfold naturally.
Modern Application & Case Studies
The Power of Slowing Down
In today's fast-paced world, people often feel pressured to be constantly productive. The glorification of busyness leads many to burnout. However, studies show that unstructured time- daydreaming, engaging in "pointless" hobbies, or simply resting — enhances creativity, mental well-being, and longevity. Just like the useless tree, we thrive when we are free from relentless expectations.
The Case of Henry David Thoreau
The American philosopher Henry David Thoreau followed Zhuangzi's philosophy when he retreated to Walden Pond, choosing a simpler, Less "useful" life over the hustle of society. His reflections, captured in Walden, continue to inspire those who seek meaning beyond material success.
Hidden Strengths of the "Useless"
Consider people who take unconventional paths-artists, philosophers, monks, or those who choose minimalism. Society often sees them as impractical, yet their contributions to culture, wisdom, and human connection are invaluable. Like the sacred tortoise, their freedom allows them to live more deeply.

Conclusion
The Useless Tree teaches us that life's greatest joys often lie outside the realm of conventional achievement. Just as the tree thrives by not being cut down, we too can flourish when we stop trying to fit into rigid definitions of success.
By questioning the value of usefulness, Zhuangzi invites us to redefine what it means to live well— not by striving, but by being.
