7 Pieces of Wisdom from Lao Tzu's Tao Te Ching A melancholic person lives in the past, an anxious person lives in the future, and a peaceful person lives in the present.Those who do not trust will be distrusted.If you do not go, you will not arrive; if you do not act, you will not achieve.If someone harms you, do not seek revenge.Instead, sit quietly by the riverside and watch the flowing water.Soon,  his body will drift by.One who chases after desire only dries oneself out in an attempt to quench the thirst.Speaking too much leads to failure, while silence leads to profound wisdom.One who knows how to be content never experiences a lack.
