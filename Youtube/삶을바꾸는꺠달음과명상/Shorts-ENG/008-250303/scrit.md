The most heinous fraud against humanity is the saying,"Tomorrow will be better than today."People call it hope, but I call it despair.The moment you believe that tomorrow will be better than today, you are deceiving yourself forever.Tomorrow will always be better because tomorrow never comes.

Those who have become slaves to their own thoughts and emotions believe that hope is an essential tool.However, life does not need hope; life needs vitality.This vitality must resonate in everything around you right now.You can only act in the present; you cannot act tomorrow.You cannot live tomorrowâ€”you can only live now.
