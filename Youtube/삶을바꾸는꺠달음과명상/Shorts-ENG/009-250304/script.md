Do you make use of what you have? Or does what you have use you? Many people are used by what they possess. One of the most misunderstood aspects of the spiritual process is asceticism. It’s not about giving something up. Even someone with just a little awareness of their natural mind will clearly see that what they’re trying to give up is dominating their life. Asceticism is fundamentally about moving toward your own freedom—from compulsion to consciousness. So, look consciously at the things you own so they don’t dominate you. It’s not about not using what you have. But in the preparation phase, some might choose to distance themselves from those things.
