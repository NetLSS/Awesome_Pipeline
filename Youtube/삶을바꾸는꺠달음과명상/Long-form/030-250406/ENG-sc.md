Part IV: Ramana's Influence on the World
Western Seekers and the Global Reach of His Teachings
The small town of Tiruvannamalai, nestled at the foot of the sacred Arunachala Hill, was an ancient place of pilgrimage, known to sages and seekers for centuries. But in the early decades of the twentieth century, something remarkable happened. A quiet presence, seated in silence beneath the shade of a mango tree or in the simple stone hall of his ashram, began to draw visitors from lands far beyond India's borders. Ramana Maharshi, who had once lived unnoticed in the caves of the holy mountain, had become a magnet for truth-seekers from around the world.
They came from different cultures, different languages, and different traditions, but all were driven by the same deep yearning. Something in Ramana's presence - something beyond words, beyond intellect - called to them. He had never traveled, never sought to spread his teachings, never claimed to be a guru, and yet, his influence reached across oceans and continents. Western seekers, many of whom had spent years studying philosophy or practicing various spiritual disciplines, arrived in Tiruvannamalai with the weight of countless questions. But in the silent radiance of Ramana's being, those questions often dissolved before they could be asked.
One of the earliest and most devoted of these seekers was Paul Brunton, a British writer and journalist who arrived in the 1930s, driven by an insatiable curiosity about the sages of India. He had roamed through monasteries and ashrams, meeting yogis and mystics, yet when he sat before Ramana Maharshi, something shifted within him. He had come expecting to hear a doctrine, a structured philosophy, something he could take back and present to the world. Instead, he found himself drawn into a profound silence, a presence so vast and still that it seemed to answer his deepest questions without a single word.
Brunton's book, A Search in Secret India, would introduce Ramana to the West, igniting a spark that would bring many more seekers to the foot of Arunachala. The idea that a man who had never left his homeland, who spoke little, who had no desire for fame or recognition, could inspire such a global movement was astonishing. And yet. it was happening. Letters arrived from Europe and America, from people who had never met him but who had read his words and felt the undeniable pull of his teaching. They did not see him as a man to be followed, but as a living embodiment of the truth they had been seeking all their lives.
For some, the journey to India was impossible, but that did not stop them from immersing themselves in his teachings. Books of his dialogues, transcribed by devoted disciples, found their way into libraries and personal collections across the world. Some Westerners, having never met him, felt as though they had. His words- so simple, so direct-cut through the complexities of philosophy and spoke straight to the heart.
Those who did manage to travel to his ashram often found themselves undergoing a transformation they had not expected. Some had spent years in spiritual disciplines that emphasized effort-rigorous practices, elaborate rituals, intellectual analysis. But when they sat in Ramana's presence, all effort seemed unnecessary. His method was the most direct of all: turn inward, trace the "I" to its source, and rest in the stillness that is already there. There were no initiations, no requirements, no special practices reserved for the advanced. There was only this one, unwavering truth.
Many of the Western seekers who came to him had been trained in the traditions of the mind. Scholars, writers, professors— people who had spent their lives exploring the nature of existence through thought. And yet, before Ramana, thought became irrelevant. They saw in him something beyond logic, something that could not be grasped through analysis or debate. Even the most intellectually inclined found themselves surrendering—not to him as a person, but to the vast silence he embodied.
Maurice Frydman, a Polish-born engineer and philosopher, was among those deeply influenced by Ramana's teachings. Though he would later be known for his work with other sages, particularly Nisargadatta Maharaj, it was Ramana who first opened his eyes to the nature of the Self. Another Western devotee, Arthur Osborne, would dedicate his life to spreading Ramana's message, ensuring that his words reached those who might never set foot in India. His writings helped bridge the cultural gap, making Ramana's teachings accessible to a world that was just beginning to open itself to the wisdom of the East.
But it was not just individuals who were touched by Ramana's presence —it was entire traditions. In the decades that followed his passing, his influence could be seen rippling through the global spiritual landscape. The non-dual teachings that had been preserved for centuries in the Upanishads and Advaita Vedanta were now finding new expressions in Western thought. Teachers, both in India and abroad, began to integrate his insights into their own approaches, making them available to students who had never encountered the depths of Eastern philosophy.
His impact was not limited to those who identified as Hindus or whofollowed traditional Advaita Vedanta. Mystics from Christian and Suf traditions, Zen practitioners, psychologists exploring the nature of consciousness all found something in Ramana's words that resonated with their own inner discoveries. His teachings were
universal, untouched by religious boundaries. He spoke not of beliefs or dogmas but of direct experience, of the undeniable truth of being itself.
The power of his presence, even decades after his passing, continued to spread. In meditation centers and retreats across the world, his image could be found — a silent reminder of the pathless path, the effortless way of self-inquiry. His words, though spoken in Tamil, echoed in countless languages, carrying the same simple message turn inward, seek the source, and know yourself as that which has always been.
Ramana Maharshi never sought to be a teacher for the world. He never intended to establish a global movement. He remained in one place, rooted in the sacred soil of Arunachala, never leaving, never seeking followers, never claiming to have anything to give. And yet, without moving a single step, he reached across the world, touching lives in ways even he might not have imagined.
Those who came to him carried his message back with them, not as mere philosophy, but as a living truth. They had seen for themselves that the mind's endless seeking could come to rest, that peace was not something to be attained but something that had always been present. And in that realization, they carried a part of his silence with them, a silence that continued to spread, undisturbed by time, undiminished by distance, as vast and boundless as the Self itself.
